1.**Description of the idea**
*(Text: max 600 words //595//)*

Work and research fields related to the humanities are constantly challenged to integrate and profit from new digital technologies. This development not only concerns the objects of investigation in the humanities but also the instruments and methodologies by with these objects can be approached. New tools for collaboration, visualization, semantic search, data analysis or online publishing bear the potential to enhance humanities research.

Yet, the humanities are widely reluctant to approach the technological layer hidden in the objects of their research interests because they have to rely on and make do with pre-fabricated digital tools that do not meet their research needs. 

Coding the Humanities (CtH) provides an open online learning environment in which humanities students can collaborativey learn how to code and create and explore the application of digital research instruments. It is inspired by collaborative software development platfroms like *github*[¹] or *koding.com*[²] and self-learning concepts such as used by *treehouse*[³] or *codecademy*[⁴]. The platform encourages project and interest based cooperation and provides resources for follow up projects and the integration of a wider audience of users and developers. 

CtH challenges conservative forms of academic top-down, expert-student (layman) learning and knowledge transfer in that it focuses on non-hierarchical, online first group learning in which the students educate one another. CtH therefore follows successful examples of open, decentralized, online-supported, tutorial based learning that are increasingly applied by successful companies.   

In contrast to the classical single author approach predominant in the humanities, software developing platforms like *github* allow and ask for collaboration. The very work process is open to mutual peer reviews, interventions and suggestions. This form of collaboration helps to form and improve projects at an early stage. The student puts less emphasis on authorship but instead orients herself towards advice and help of peers. The code of the projects is well documented and due to open licenses accessible to anyone. The projects are sustainable in the sense that other students or programmers in general can join them, take over a 'finished' or abandoned project, change and improve it. 
The learning environment thus not only encourages collaboration between UvA humanities students during accompanying courses but is moreover open for collaborations on a bigger scale, e.g. with other universities, labs, SMEs or civic movements.  

The programming language the students learn first, JavaScript, allows the creation and application of a broad range of data visualization such as cartography, timelines, graphs, diagrams or animations. The students can experiment with of existing JavaScript libraries such as *Data Driven Documents*[⁵] and still gain good control over the visual outcome. These tools enhance the analysis and understanding of complex relations and concepts relevant to humanities research. At the same time data sets become comprehensible and presentable to a broader audience as well. The developed tools can be applied to different data sets. Especially with regard to open data sets provided by more and more cultural institutions and organizations[⁶], data visualization tools provide a great foundation for collaborative activities between universiies and other institutions.

With its focus on code CtH aims to form a basis for collaborations between public and private partners that are keen to explore new means of knowledge production and productively challenge conventional forms of teaching and scholarship by the creation of innovative information infrastructures and research environments. 

CtH encourages humanities students to translate their research needs into applications. At the same time the training of humanities students in coding and the creation and use of those applications can open new fields and perspectives for humanities research.


2.**Innovativeness: why is your idea innovative?**
*(Text: max 300 words //241//)*

The CtH project breaks with the standard approach in digital humanities that focuses on tools with user-friendly interfaces while forcing researchers to fit their research to what the tools allow. It encourages experimentation with new methods instead of reproducing the same analyses on a limited set of appropriate data. It gives humanities students the ability to create their research tools themselves and to critically analyse the digital tools surrounding them.

Such a platform invites students to take on a more collaborative problem solving approach that is already in practice in companies in the creative industries sector. Moreover, this meets the demand from both cultural institutions and development companies for employees with a humanities background and coding skills. 

The open nature of the project fits well with the larger open source community---where people acquire their coding skills in a similar collaborative way---and the growing amount of open data that is waiting to be explored by young, creative researchers.

Due to collaborative means used by open source software developers (e.g. github) also research projects limited in duration and resources become sustainable, in the sense that they can be continued even when the initial researcher leaves the projects. Due to open licenses, they can be further developed and improved.

This openness is inclusive, as it also allows - due to documentation and tutors - people without a background in coding to participate and develope a sensibility towards the digital instruments at hand.


3.**Societal and/or commercial benefit: which specific problem can be solved with your idea?** 
*(Text: max 300 words //301//)*      

Jobs related to the humanities now strongly rely on digital tools, in terms of communication, collaboration, documentation, visualization or analysis. Coding the Humanities prepares students not only to understand but also to form these digital instruments and integrate them in their studies. CtH will therefore enable students to develop new research questions and keep pace with the rapid changes in their research environment.  

Humanities students catch up on working with open source inspired methods already successfully applied at companies. They learn to handle and understand the ITC now essential to the work flow in modern SMEs. Thus CtH diminishes the knowledge gap between reseach/studies and the working world and hence makes humanities students more employable. At the same time employers can benefit from the synergy effects of this double skillset. 

Private partners or companies in general terms will find various contact points to engage with the project. They can research on and co-create a learning environment that meets humanities research needs, but is potentially open for the inclusion of and cooperation with a large group of programmers and amateurs who want to learn programming. They can supply data sets programmers can experiment and work with. Oganizations concerned with open data can formulate projects including students or a larger public that focus on these open data sets. Moreover universities, institutions or companies can benefit from the programs developed by students and partners.

Finally, CtH is also a modest attempt to close the digital divide[⁸] that eventually attempts to empower more people, of all ages, to work with data that is increasingly made accessible by museums, archives, libraries, municipalities and governments.  In its ideal form it enlightens a general puplic and builds the foundation for self-educational structures in which projects can develop according to needs and interests of students and society.


4.**Application: which application do you envisage?**
*(Text: max 300 words //123//)*

The application envisioned is an online learning environment that provides moduled tutorials which allow students to learn programming languages like JavaScript by themselves, with the help of peers and, eventually, an active community. For this reason the environment will include discussion boards on which the students can ask for advice, formulate interests that result in group based projects and discuss the state of running projects.
This online learning environment will be connected to the collaborative development platform *github* as a means to store and collaboratively work on coding projects. This platform allows the students to simulatniously work on a project, develop different versions of a project, document changes by detailed versioning and allow others at any developing stage of the project to contribute. 


5.**Feasibility: how are you going to enroll your idea and introduce it to market** *(Text: max 300 words //274//)*

Currently, in a seminar phase, UvA students learn how to code in JavaScript, use github, firebase and other tools in order to produce small projects[⁷]. This phase provides a promising outlook for the next stage, which foresees the development of a pilot platform. This platform relies on successful open source or free to use online collaboration platforms and tools. The website http://codingthehumanities.com/ will function as a first contact point for UvA student volunteers and will provide them basic instructions and orientation concerning the needed resources. 
This approach allows a swift start to advance the project as soon as possible. At the same time, the analysis and evaluation of the students' work will generate valuable insights about the features that should be included in the to be developmed platform. For the design and the development of the actual online learning environment, the project seeks to collaborate with different private partners. By understanding the students' needs and combining this understanding with the expertise of our partners, we will be enabled to decide how to best make use of existing open source software and which features of the platform will have to be developed from scratch.
With the prototype in developing phase and a first pool of students keen on humanities research and coding at hand, extended partnerships, e.g. with the *Creative Industries Research Centre Amsterdam*[⁹] and the UvA's *Centre for Digital Humanities*[¹⁰]  as well as cultural institutions or civic organizations will be initiated. 
The continuation of the *Coding Sessions*[¹¹] events will make the project known to a wider audience and extend the network of potential partners.
