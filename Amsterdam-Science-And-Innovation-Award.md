1.**Description of the idea**
*(Text: max 600 words)*

Work and research fields related to the humanities are constantly challenged to integrate and profit from new digital technologies. This development not only concerns the objects of investigation in the humanities but also the instruments and methodologies by with these objects can be approached. New tools for collaboration, visualization, semantic search, data analysis or online publishing bear the potential to enhance humanities research.

Yet, the humanities are widely reluctant the technological layer hidden in the objects of their research interests because they have to rely on and make do with pre-fabricated digital tools that do not meet their research needs. 

Coding the Humanities (CtH) provides an open online learning environment in which humanities students can collaboratively learn how to code and create and explore the application of digital research instruments. It is inspired by collaborative software development platfroms like *github*[¹] or *koding.com*[²] and self-learning concepts such as used by *treehouse*[³] or *codecademy*[⁴]. The platform encourages project and interest based cooperation and provides resources for follow up projects and the integration of a wider audience of users and developers. 

CtH challenges conservative forms of academic top-down, expert-student (layman) learning and knowledge transfer in that it focuses on non-hierarchical, online first group learning in which the students educate one another. //CtH therefore follows successful examples of open, decentralized, online-supported, tutorial based learning that are increasingly applied by successful companies now.//   

In contrast to the classical single author approach predominant in the humanities, software developing platforms like *github* allow and ask for collaboration. The very work process is open to mutual peer reviews, interventions and suggestions. This form of collaboration helps to form and improve projects at an early stage. The student puts less emphasis on authorship but instead orients herself towards advice and help of peers. The code of the projects is well documented and due to open licenses accessible to anyone. The projects are sustainable in the sense that other students or programmers in general can join them, take over a 'finished' or abandoned project, change and improve it. 
The learning environment thus encourages collaboration between UvA humanities students during accompanying courses but is moreover open for collaborations on a bigger scale, e.g. with other universities, labs, SMEs or civic movements.  

The programming language the students learn first, JavaScript, allows the creation and application of a broad range of data visualization such as cartography, timelines, graphs, diagrams or animations. The students can experiment with of existing JavaScript libraries such *Data Driven Documents*[⁵] and still gain good control over the visual outcome. These tools enhance the analysis and understanding of complex relations and concepts relevant to humanities research. At the same time data sets become comprehensible and presentable to a broader audience as well. The developed tools can be applied to different data sets. Especially with regard to open data sets provided by more and more cultural institutions and organizations[⁶], data visualization tools provide a great foundation for coollaborative between universities and other institutions.

With its focus on code CtH aims to form a basis for collaborations between public and private partners that are keen to explore new means of knowledge production and productively challenge conventional forms of teaching and scholarship by the creation of innovative information infrastructures and research environments. 

CtH encourages humanities students to translates their research needs into applications. At the same time the training of humanities students in coding and the creation and use of the applications can open new fields and perspectives for humanities research.



2.**Innovativeness: why is your idea innovative?**
*(Text: max 300 words)*

The CtH project breaks with the standard approach in digital humanities of focusing on tools that have user friendly interfaces but force researchers to fit their research to what the tools allow. It encourages experimentation with new methods instead of reproducing the same analyses on a limited set of appropriate data. It gives humanities students the ability to create their research tools themselves and to critically analyse the digital tools surrounding them.

Such a platform invites students to take on a more collaborative problem solving approach that is already in practice in companies in the creative industries sector. Moreover, this meets the demand from both cultural institutions and development companies for employees with a humanities background and coding skills. 

The open nature of the project fits well with the larger open source community---where people acquire their coding skills in a similar collaborative way---and the growing amount of open data that is waiting to be explored by young, creative researchers.

Due to collaborative means used by open source software developers (e.g. github) research projects become sustainable, in the sense that they can be taken over if the initial researcher leaves the projects. Due to open licenses, they can be developed and improved upon.

This openess is inclusive, as it also allows - due to documentation and tutors - people without a background in coding to participate and develope a sensibility towards the digital instruments at hand.


3.**Societal and/or commercial benefit: which specific problem can be 
psolved with your idea?** (Text: max 300 words)      

Jobs related to the humanities nowadays strongly rely on digital tools, in terms of communication, collaboration, documentation, vizualization or analysis. 
Coding the Humanities prepares students not only to understand but to form these digital instruments already during their studies. It will therefore enable students to develop new research questions and keep pace with the rapid change in their research environment.  

Humanities students catch up with working methods already successfully applied at many companies. They learn to handle and understand the digital tools now essential to the work flow in modern SMEs. Thus CtH diminishes the knowledge gap between reseach/studies and the working world and hence makes humanities students more employable. At the same time employers in the creative industries sector can benefit from the synergy effects of this double skillset. 

Private partners or companies in gerneral terms can engage with the project on various levels. They can co-create a learning environment that meets humanities research needs, but is potentially open for the inclusion of and cooperation with a large group of programmes and amateurs who what to learn programming. They can supply data sets the programmes can experiment and work with and they can develop own projects by utilizing the code the students created.

Finally, CtH is also a modest attempt to close the digital divide //[footnote]// that eventually attempts to empower more people, young and old, to work with data increasingly made accessible by museums, archives, libraries, municipals or governments.  In its ideal form it enlightens a gerneral puplic and build the foundation for self-educational structures in which projects can develop according to needs and insterests of students and society.

description of the features learning platform?


5.**Feasibility: how are you going to enroll your idea and introduce it
to market** *(Text: max 300 words)*

In a seminar phase still ongoing UvA students learne how to code in JaveScript, use github, firebase and other tools and produced small projects[⁷] that give a promising outlook for the next stage of the project. 
This stage will produce pilot platform which still relies on successful open source or free to use online collaboration platforms and tools. The website http://codingthehumanities.com/ is going to function as a first contact point for the voluntary UvA students and provide them gives basic instructions and orientation to the reseources needed. 
This approach allows to start and advance the project as soon as possible. At the same time the analysis and evaluation of the students work will generate valuable insight on the features the real platform should include. For the design and the development of the actual online learning environment we work together with different private partners. The understanding of the students needs and the expertise of our partners will allow us to decide, for which features already existing open source software can be use, for which features open source softeware has to be altered and which features have to be developed from scratch.
//Cooperation: with the prototype in development and a first pool of students keen on humanities research and coding at hand, extended partnerships, e.g. with the Creative Industries Research Centre Amsterdam http://circa.uva.nl/ and the UvA Centre for Digital Humanities http://cdh.uva.nl/ as well as cultural institutions or civic organizations can be formed.
