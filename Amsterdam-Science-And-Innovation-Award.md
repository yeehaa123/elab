1.**Description of the idea**
*(Text: max 600 words)*

In recent years we have witnessed an increasing demand in coding
experience in various working fields closely related to the humanities.
Knowledge institutions require programs to archive, search, digitize
and present their rich heritage. Media professionals, but also
archaeologists, musicians or historians more and more rely on digital
resources for their work and need basic coding skills to enhance their
workflow and research. But already at university level coding skills
become an important instrument to pursue ambitious research interests.

'Coding the Humanities' is addressing these changing work and research
requirements by providing humanities students with an on- and offline
learning and research environment which allows them to develop and apply
coding skills, so that they are empowered to produce the customized
digital tools that fit their research and work. CTH is not only
increasing the employability of humanities students but also connects
external partners to students who understand to analyze and approach
humanities questions from the perspective of coding.

'Coding the Humanities' aims to be an incubator for collaborations
between public and private partners that are keen to explore new means
of knowledge production and productively challenge conventional forms
of teaching and scholarship by the creation of innovative information
infrastructures and research environments. It is intended to be an open
space for learning, exploration through collaboration.

At the same time it challenges traditional top down educational         
concepts and instead embraces the power of peer-learning and reviewing, 
interest based research groups, open data and licenses.                 

This approach, at the same time provides a powerful basis for
collaborations with other universities, SMEs and even community based
movenments and laymen.

// YEEHAA: This part is too general. IMO it should be focused on the
platform, and how this will transform learning and research in general

It needs concrete topics, for instance:

+ Collaboration
+ Visualisation
+ Publishing

and examples:

+ Github
+ D3
+ PKP

etc.

2.**Innovativeness: why is your idea innovative?**
*(Text: max 300 words)*

+ Provides humanities students with the ability to create their research
tools themselves

+ Provides humanities students with the ability to analyse the digital
tools surrounding them

+ Allows them to take on a more collaborative problem solving approach
that is already in practice in companies in the creative industries
sector

+ Meets the demand by cultural institutions for employees with a
humanities background and coding skills

+ Possibly connects to the upcoming open data

+ Due to collaborative means used by open source software developers
(e.g. github) the projects become sustainable, in the sense that they
can be taken over if the maintainer leaves the projects. Due to open
licenses, they can be developed and improved

+ This openess is inclusive, as it also allows - due to documentation
and tutors - people without a background in coding to participate and
develope a sensibility towards the digital instruments at hand


3.**Societal and/or commercial benefit: which specific problem can be 
psolved with your idea?** (Text: max 300 words)      

Jobs related to the humanities nowadays strongly rely on digital tools,
in terms of communication, collaboration, documentation, vizualization
or analysis. Coding the Humanities will prepare students to understand
these digital instruments already during their studies, instead of
having to aquire these skills on the job. Moreover the students will be
aquianted with the new forms of collaboration and ICT based knowledge
production that are increasingly adopted by companies in the creative
industries. /no proof for that yet/ Employers in the creative industries
can benefit from the synergy effects of this double skillset and do
not have to rely mere on ITC experts. At the same time due to the use
of open license like creative commons, the project provides links to
integrate SMEs as well as social and civic movements. In its ideal
form it enlightens a gerneral puplic and build the foundation for
self-educational structures in which projects can develop according to
needs and insterests of students and society.


4.**Application: which application do you envisage?**
*(Text: max 300 words)*


5.**Feasibility: how are you going to enroll your idea and introduce it
to market** *(Text: max 300 words)*

The project will be enrolled as a pilot seminar at the UvA in which the
virtual platform will be linked to a pilot of a physical space within
the UvA buildings. As a start the students will rely on github as a
collaborative platform. For the conception of the virtual learning
environment as for the physical lab, we are coorperating with different
external partners with expertise in collaborative concepts, software
development and elearning. Furthermore we are going encouraging
cultural institutions to cooperate on open data projects and animate
the students to form their own interest and discipline related
research groups which engage and work with the data already available
at [http://www.opencultuurdata.nl/](http://www.opencultuurdata.nl/)
and work together with the [open knowledge
foundation](http://nl.okfn.org/) in order to stage events like
[http://codingdavinci.de/](http://codingdavinci.de/).
