1.**Description of the idea**
*(Text: max 600 words)*

Work and research fields related to the humanities are constantly challenged to integrate and profit from new digital technologies. This development not only concerns the objects of investigation of the humanities but also the instruments and methodologies by with these objects can be approached. New tools for collaboration, visualization, semantic search, data analysis or online publishing bear the potential to enhance humanities research.

Yet, the humanities are widely reluctant the technological layer hidden in the objects of their research interests because they have to rely on and make do with pre-fabricated digital tools that do not meet their research needs. 

Coding the Humanities (CtH) provides an open online learning environment in which humanities students can collaboratively learn how to code and create and explore the application of digital research instruments. It is inspired by collaborative software development platfroms like *github* or *koding.com* and self-learning concepts successfully used by *treehouse* or *codcademy*. The platform encourages project and interest based cooperation and provides resources for follow up projects and the integration of a wider audience of users and developers. 

CtH challenges conservative forms of academic top-down, expert-student (layman) learning and knowledge transfer in that it focuses on non-hierarchical, online first group learning in which the students educate one another. //CtH therefore follows successful examples of open, decentralized, online-supported, tutorial based learning that are applied by many companies now.//   

In contrast to the classical single author approach predominant in the humanities, software developing platforms like *github* allow and ask for collaboration. The very work process is open to mutual peer reviews, interventions and suggestions. This form of collaboration helps to form and improve projects at an early stage. The student puts less emphasis on authorship but instead orients herself towards advice and help of peers. The code of the projects is well documented and due to open licenses accessible to anyone. The projects are sustainable in the sense that other students or programmers in general can join them, take over a 'finished' or abandoned project and change and improve it. 
The learning environment thus encourages collaboration between UvA humanities students during accompanying courses but is moreover open for collaborations on a bigger scale.  

The programming language the students learn first, JavaScript, allows the creation and application of a broad range of data visualization such as cartography, timelines, graphs, diagrams or animations. The students can experiment with of existing code JavaScript libraries such *Data Driven Documents* and still gain good control over the visual outcome. These tools enhance the analysis and understanding of complex relations and concepts relevant to humanities research. At the same time data sets become comprehensible and presentable to a broader audience as well. The developed tools can be related to different data sets and are particularly interesting with regard to open data sets provided by more and more cultural institutions and organizations. Also here a the possibilities for cooperations are striking.

With its focus on code CtH aims to become a basis for collaborations between public and private partners that are keen to explore new means of knowledge production and productively challenge conventional forms of teaching and scholarship by the creation of innovative information infrastructures and research environments. 

CtH encourages humanities students to translates their research needs into applications. At the same time the training of humanities students in coding and the creation and use of the applications can open new fields and perspectives for humanities research.

// YEEHAA: This part is too general. IMO it should be focused on the
platform, and how this will transform learning and research in general

It needs concrete topics, for instance:

+ Collaboration
+ Visualisation
+ Publishing

and examples:

+ Github
+ D3
+ PKP

etc.

2.**Innovativeness: why is your idea innovative?**
*(Text: max 300 words)*

The CtH project breaks with the standard approach in digital humanities of focusing on tools that have user friendly interfaces but force researchers to fit their research to what the tools allow. It encourages experimentation with new methods instead of reproducing the same analyses on a limited set of appropriate data. It gives humanities students the ability to create their research tools themselves and to critically analyse the digital tools surrounding them.

Such a platform invites students to take on a more collaborative problem solving approach that is already in practice in companies in the creative industries sector. Moreover, this meets the demand from both cultural institutions and development companies for employees with a humanities background and coding skills. 

The open nature of the project fits well with the larger open source community---where people acquire their coding skills in a similar collaborative way---and the growing amount of open data that is waiting to be explored by young, creative researchers.

Due to collaborative means used by open source software developers (e.g. github) research projects become sustainable, in the sense that they can be taken over if the initial researcher leaves the projects. Due to open licenses, they can be developed and improved upon.

This openess is inclusive, as it also allows - due to documentation and tutors - people without a background in coding to participate and develope a sensibility towards the digital instruments at hand.


3.**Societal and/or commercial benefit: which specific problem can be 
psolved with your idea?** (Text: max 300 words)      

Jobs related to the humanities nowadays strongly rely on digital tools,
in terms of communication, collaboration, documentation, vizualization
or analysis. Coding the Humanities will prepare students to understand
these digital instruments already during their studies, instead of
having to aquire these skills on the job. Moreover the students will be
aquianted with the new forms of collaboration and ICT based knowledge
production that are increasingly adopted by companies in the creative
industries. //no proof for that yet//
Employers in the creative industries sector can benefit from the synergy effects of this double skillset and do
not have to rely mere on ITC experts. At the same time due to the use
of open license like creative commons, the project provides links to
integrate SMEs as well as social and civic movements. In its ideal
form it enlightens a gerneral puplic and build the foundation for
self-educational structures in which projects can develop according to
needs and insterests of students and society.


4.**Application: which application do you envisage?**
*(Text: max 300 words)*
description of the features learning platform?


5.**Feasibility: how are you going to enroll your idea and introduce it
to market** *(Text: max 300 words)*

The project will be enrolled as a pilot seminar at the UvA in which the
virtual platform will be linked to a pilot of a physical space within
the UvA buildings. As a start the students will rely on github as a
collaborative platform. For the conception of the virtual learning
environment as for the physical lab, we are coorperating with different
external partners with expertise in collaborative concepts, software
development and elearning. Furthermore we are going encouraging
cultural institutions to cooperate on open data projects and animate
the students to form their own interest and discipline related
research groups which engage and work with the data already available
at [http://www.opencultuurdata.nl/](http://www.opencultuurdata.nl/)
and work together with the [open knowledge
foundation](http://nl.okfn.org/) in order to stage events like
[http://codingdavinci.de/](http://codingdavinci.de/).
