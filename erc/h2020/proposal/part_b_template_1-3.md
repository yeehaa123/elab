#Proposal template 
(technical annex)

##Coordination and support actions


*Please follow the structure of this template when preparing your proposal. It has been designed to ensure that the 
important aspects of your planned work are presented in a way that will enable the experts to make an effective 
assessment against the evaluation  criteria. Sections 1, 2 and 3 each correspond to an evaluation criterion for a full 
proposal.* 

*Page limit: For full proposals, the cover page, and sections 1, 2 and 3, together should not be longer than 50 pages. 
All tables in these sections must be included within this limit. The minimum font size allowed is 11 points.  The page 
size is A4, and all margins (top, bottom, left, right) should be at least 15 mm (not including any footers or headers).* 
*If you attempt to upload a proposal longer than the specified limit, before the deadline you will receive an automatic warning, and will be advised to shorten and re-upload the proposal. After the deadline, any excess pages will be overprinted with a ‘watermark’, indicating to evaluators that these pages must be disregarded.*

*Please do not consider the page limit as a target! It is in your interest to keep your text as concise as possible, since experts rarely view unnecessarily long proposals in a positive light.*

##Table of Contents


###1. Excellence 

*Your proposal must address a topic set out in the work programme, for this call for proposals. This section of your proposal will be assessed only to the extent that it is relevant to that topic.*


####1.1 Objectives 
*Describe the specific objectives for the project1, which should be clear, measurable, realistic and achievable within the duration of the project. Objectives should be consistent with the expected exploitation and impact of the project (see section 2).* 


####1.2 Relation to the work programme 

*Indicate the work programme topic to which your proposal relates, and explain how your proposal addresses the specific challenge and scope of that topic, as set out in the work programme.* 

####1.3 Concept and approach, quality of the coordination and support measures

*Describe and explain the overall concept underpinning the project. Describe the main ideas, models or assumptions involved;* 
 
*Describe any national or international research and innovation activities which will be linked with the project, especially where the outputs from these will feed into the project;*

*Describe and explain the overall approach, distinguishing, as appropriate, coordination and support activities;* 

*Where relevant, describe how sex and/or gender analysis is taken into account in the project’s content.*

*Sex and gender refer to biological characteristics and social/cultural factors respectively. For guidance on methods of sex / gender analysis and the issues to be taken into account, please refer to [http://ec.europa.eu/research/science-society/gendered-innovations/index_en.cfm](http://ec.europa.eu/research/science-society/gendered-innovations/index_en.cfm)*


###2. Impact 

####2.1 Expected impacts 

*Please be specific, and provide only information that applies to the proposal and its objectives. Wherever possible, use quantified indicators and targets.*

*Describe how your project will contribute to the expected impacts set out in the work programme, under the relevant topic;*

*Describe any barriers/obstacles, and any framework conditions (such as regulation and standards), that may determine whether and to what extent the expected impacts will be achieved. (This should not include any risk factors concerning implementation, as covered in section 3.2.)* 


####2.2 Measures to maximise impact

**a) Dissemination and exploitation of results** 

*Provide a draft ‘plan for disseminating and exploiting the project’s results’ (unless the work programme topic explicitly states that such a plan is not required). The plan, which should be proportionate to the scale of the project, should contain measures to be implemented both during and after the project;*  

*Dissemination and exploitation measures should address the full range of potential users and uses including research, commercial, investment, social, environmental, policy making, setting standards, skills and educational training.* 

*The approach to innovation should be as comprehensive as possible, and must be tailored to the specific technical, market and organisational issues to be addressed.* 
 
*Explain how the proposed measures will help to achieve the expected impact of the project. Include a business plan where relevant;*

*Where relevant, include information on how the participants will manage the research data generated and/or collected during the project, in particular addressing the following issues2:*

*What types of data will the project generate/collect?*

*What standards will be used?*

*How will this data be exploited and/or shared/made accessible for verification and re-use? If data cannot be made available, explain why.*

*How will this data be curated and preserved?*  

*You will need an appropriate consortium agreement to manage (amongst other things) the ownership and access to key knowledge (IPR, data etc.). These will allow you, collectively and individually, to pursue market opportunities arising from the project's results.*  

*Outline the strategy for knowledge management and protection. Include measures to provide open access (free on-line access such as the ‘green’ or ‘gold’ model) to peer-reviewed scientific publications which might result from the project3.*

*Open access publishing (also called 'gold' open access) means that an article is immediately provided in open access mode by the scientific publisher. The associated costs are usually shifted away from readers, and instead (for example) to the university or research institute to which the researcher is affiliated, or to the funding agency supporting the research.* 

*Self-archiving (also called 'green' open access) means that the published article or the final peer-reviewed manuscript is archived by the researcher - or a representative - in an online repository before, after or alongside its publication. Access to this article is often - but not necessarily - delayed (‘embargo period’) as some scientific publishers may wish to recoup their investment by selling subscriptions and charging pay-per-download/view fees during an exclusivity period.*


**b) Communication activities**

Describe the proposed communication measures for promoting the project and its findings during the period of the grant. Measures should be proportionate to the scale of the project, with clear objectives.  They should be tailored to the needs of various audiences, including groups beyond the project’s own community. Where relevant, include measures for public/societal engagement on issues related to the project. 


###3. Implementation

####3.1	Work plan – Work packages, deliverables and milestones

*Please provide the following:*

*brief presentation of the overall structure of the work plan* 
*timing of the different work packages and their components (Gantt chart or similar)*
*detailed work description, i.e.:*
*a description of each work package (table 3.1a)*
*a list of work packages (table 3.1b);*
*a list of major deliverables (table 3.1c);*
*graphical presentation of the components showing how they inter-relate (Pert chart or similar)*

*Give full details. Base your account on the logical structure of the project and the stages in which it is to be carried out. Include details of the resources to be allocated to each work package. The number of work packages should be proportionate to the scale and complexity of the project.* 

*You should give enough detail in each work package to justify the proposed resources to be allocated and also quantified information so that progress can be monitored, including by the Commission.* 

*You are advised to include a distinct work package on ‘Management’ (see section 3.2), and to give due visibility in the work plan to ‘dissemination and exploitation’ and ‘communication activities’, either with distinct tasks, or possibly distinct work packages.* 

*You will be required to include an updated (or confirmed) plan for ‘dissemination and exploitation’ in both the mid-term and final reports. (This does not apply to topics where a draft plan was not required.) This should include a record of activities related to dissemination and exploitation that have been undertaken, and those still planned. A report of completed and planned communication activities will also be required.* 

*If your project is taking part in the Pilot on Open Research Data4, you must include a 'data management plan' as a distinct deliverable within the first 6 months of the project. A template for such a plan is given in the guidelines on data management in the H2020 Online Manual. This deliverable will evolve during the lifetime of the project in order to present the status of the project's reflections on data management.*

**Definitions:**

**Work package** *means a major sub-division of the proposed project*

**Deliverable** *means a distinct output of the project, meaningful in terms of the project’s  overall objectives, and constituted by a report, a document, a technical diagram, a software etc.*

**‘Milestones’** *means control points in the project that help to chart progress. Milestones may correspond to the completion of a key deliverable, allowing the next phase of the work to begin. They may also be needed at intermediary points so that, if problems have arisen, corrective measures can be taken. A milestone may be a critical decision point in the project where, for example, the consortium must decide which of several technologies to adopt for further development.*



####3.2	Management structure and procedures 
 
*Describe the organisational structure and the decision-making (including a list of milestones (table 3.2a));*

*Explain why the organisational structure and decision-making mechanisms are appropriate to the complexity and scale of the project;*

*Describe, where relevant, how effective innovation management will be addressed  in the management structure and work plan;*

*Innovation management is a process which requires an understanding of both market and technical problems, with a goal of successfully implementing appropriate creative ideas. A new or improved product, service or process is its typical output. It also allows a consortium to respond to an external or internal opportunity.*

*Describe any critical risks, relating to project implementation, that the stated project’s objectives may not be achieved. Detail any risk mitigation measures. Please provide a table with critical risks identified and mitigating actions (table 3.2b).*



####3.3	Consortium as a whole 

*The individual members of the consortium are described in a separate section 4. There is no need to repeat that information here.* 

*Describe the consortium. How will it match the project’s objectives? How do the members complement one another (and cover the value chain, where appropriate)? In what way does each of them contribute to the project? How will they be able to work effectively together?* 

*If applicable, describe the industrial/commercial involvement in the project to ensure exploitation of the results and explain why this is consistent with and will help to achieve the specific measures which are proposed for exploitation of the results of the project (see section 2.3).* 

**Other countries:** *If one or more of the participants requesting EU funding is based in a country that is not automatically eligible for such funding (entities from Member States of the EU, from Associated Countries and from one of the countries in the exhaustive list included in General Annex A of the work programme General Annex A of the work programme are automatically eligible for EU funding), explain why the participation of the entity in question is essential to carrying out the project.* 


####3.4	Resources to be committed 

*Please make sure the information in this section matches the costs as stated in the budget table in section 3 of the administrative proposal forms, and the number of person/months, shown in the detailed work package descriptions.
Please provide the following:*

*a table showing number of person/months required (table 3.4a);*

*a table showing ‘other direct costs’ (table 3.4b) for participants where those costs exceed 15% of the personnel costs (according to the table in section 3 of the administrative proposal forms).*
