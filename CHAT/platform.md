## Project Description 

### Main Research Question 

At its core, this project endeavors to explore how programming opens
up new, innovative types of learning and research in the humanities.
To answer this question, we want to design a coding platform that
accelerates these processes and creates new models for collaboration
in the humanities. Through the platform, we will explore what forms
of (collaborative) interaction models programming allows (see user
interaction models, Bradley, 2004). We will also investigate about how
scholarly primitives (Unsworth, 2002) can better guide the development
and investigation of tools.

### Goal and Problem

Within digital humanities research a broad range of tools is used for
analysis of digital materials. Humanities scholars often have little
interest in the details of how the tools work, but prefer to focus on
what they can be used for. However, understanding the intricate details
of tools is important when drawing conclusions from and basing claims on
the results from tools.

In collaborative projects with computer scienctist, the latter have
more interest in those details, but may lack the domain expertise
to understand the full consequences of implementation details for
humanities research At the University of Amsterdam, we are currently
developing a collaborative platform for building and reflecting on
humanities tools through programming

In this project we investigate ways to develop this platform in which
collaboration learning and research is intuitive and effective. The Goal
of this project is to get humanities and computer science perspective to
inform, enrich and enhance each other.

How can the (self)critical reflection of the humanities be brought
to bear on programming solutions? And how can programming enhance
reflection on tools and their use for humanities research aims to
create an expandable platform for humanities students and scholars to
collaboratively learn programming and build tools for their research.

In order to initiate a fruitful debate about the development and
application of ICT it is crucial not only to start that debate among ICT
experts. On the contrary, this debate should evolve around users and
their needs. Thus one of the main challenges to face for the creation of
a sustainable dialogue about the opportunities ICT offers is to interest
and educate non-technologically biased persons, meaning those who are
not motivated by technology in and of itself, but want to know how it
can contribute to their needs before investing in it. This perspective
often lacks from standard ICT courses and tutorials, including those on
programming.

### How this research contributes to the humanities, and to ‘digital humanities’

CtH pursues this goal by providing an online learning interface
that reaches out both to humanities students and scholars, and to
non-technologically biased people in general by lowering the threshold
to engage with ICT. This platform therefore opens up the closed
university realm for the education up to bigger numbers and overcomes
the limitation of ICT training to a cultural, technological and
economical elite. It integrates the humanities with the digital
humanities.

Whereas classical digital humanities programs often rely on ICT experts
that develop programs for the humanities and provide for supportive
actions for the implementation of these tools, coding the humanities
seeks to train the students and researchers themselves to shape ICT
and understand the possibilities that the tools they hold in their
hands offer. Hereby the online platform intends to enlarge the circle
of people that are involved in the development of ICT beyond the small
group of experts.

### Relation to ‘Opportunities for the humanities’ section of the white paper

The platform provides students and scholars in the humanities with the
tools to create new ways to communicate their research interactively.
It develops new tools that include options for multiple categorization,
making classification systems maliable to new discoveries and points of
view.

Organizational opportunities: the platform will foster new forms of
collaborations between scholars of different humanities disciplines and
between humanities and computer science.

### How this research contributes to one or more of the core technologies in section 1 of the white paper

Programming underlies all five core technological challenges and a
diverse group of researchers collaboration on projects on the platform
will cover the whole range of technical challenges and all areas of the
humanities.

The platform provides an "online first" approach which means that
the students find the means to learn coding and work collaboratively
online first through courses and tutorials but can complement these
tools with offline meetings. This approach avoids the mere transfer
of offline teaching methods into the online world, which is a typical
weakness of many Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), but explores what
offline collaboration can be informed by strategies applied with online
tools and how innovative offline practices can initiate and foster
online cooperation. It seeks to provide students with the technological
foundations to acquire and develop these skills by themselves and in
peer learning based processes, based on tutorials and assignments.

CtH projects are produced and stored under open licenses which
encourages the collaboration and reuse of the software tools by other
institutions, companies or partners and therefore provides. These
platform in this sense triggers direct debate on the status of ICT in
the humanities.

In times of big data more and more data is available but not necessary turned into knowledge. The Coding the Humanities platform educates students, researchers and non-technologically biased people on how to approach this data. It allows its participants to gain insights by addressing these datasets. The CtH projects and tools are therefore easily relateable to already existing open data movements - it seeks to provide its users with digital agency that evolves into debates on open data. 


### How this research builds on relevant state-of-the-art research:

 There are several Accessibility 

### Why the proposed research team would be the best to perform this research:

As far as we know, there is very little research in this area. 
Companies offering online learning platforms like Apearo, Edx have no courses in this direction. There are programming courses offered for non-computer science students, but they often engage students with technical jargon and a perspective that lacks relevance to those with no such technological bias but a need to know what programming skills have to offer them.

### Plans for software and data management and sharing

 The platform will embrace open source culture and all contributions to the platform and projects developed on the platform are published using open licenses. The students share their code projects on distributed repositories, which encourages re-use, altering and further development.

Year 2: Both PhD students and the post-doc will publish at least two papers to present at two or three conferences, and at least one paper to be published in an academic journal. 
Year 3: The post-doc will publish four or five papers to present at four or fice conferences, and will complete the post-doc. The PhD students will continue to publish and present at conferences, including at least five conferences.
Year 4: The PhDs will publish three articles each in academic journals, and will present these articles at at least three conferences. The PhDs will complete their dissertations.


#### Key Deliverables
The platform for collaborative humanities research through programming that this project will develop is in itself a key deliverable. The platform will create new libraries for tool building, as well as tools and guidelines / best practices for collaboration. The PhD and post-doc researchers will publish articles for conferences and journals on topics of new forms of valorizing humanities research. 


#### Valorization

Programming underlies all five core technological challenges and a
diverse group of researchers collaboration on projects on the platform
will cover the whole range of technical challenges and all areas of the
humanities.

#### Societal and economic benefits:

The platform is developed to be inclusive. People who are reluctant to
engage with technology in research because of the technologically biased
approach of most trainings will find a more inviting humanities-oriented
approach to learning those skills. Knowledge of programming and better
models of collaboration reduces the power of the elite over the rest.
 
#### Teaching and training benefits:
The platform is used directly to train staff of the CHAT partners. Partners from different backgrounds and disciplines learn to communicate better through a shared vocabulary by learning to program and develop their research projects on the platform. This also leads to better visibility of who does what and a stronger, more connected, network for collaboration among the CHAT partners. 

#### Contribution to long-term development of CHAT:
The platform will create a pool of young, technically proficient humanities scholars, and humanities-informed computer/information science students who would be familiar with and well-connected to CHAT as an excellent network to further their research careers.

## How does this research build on relevant state-of-the-art research

One of the premisses of this project is that there is hardly any state of the
art research on this topic. The digital tools that are used in humanities
research are hardly ever topic of discussion or reflection. The building of new
custom made tools, such as the platform that we suggest, is even more rare. 

That being said, our project does build on some pioneering work by people such
as Stefan Sinclair (McGill), John Willinsky (Stanford), Alan Liu (University of
Santa Barbara), Geoff Bowker (UC Irvine), and Siva Tralalala (University of
Virginia). All of which are involved as advisors in our project.
