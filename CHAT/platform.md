## Project Description 

### Main Research Question 

This project explores how coding can open up new, innovative types
of learning and research in the humanities. To answer this question,
we will design a coding platform that accelerates these processes
and creates new models for collaboration in the humanities. 

### Goal and Problem

This project aims to increase the number of people who approach learning and research collaboratively, through an online platform where users learn programming and build tools, thereby increasing digital literacy and at the same time lowering the technological threshold to engage with and reflect on digital tools. The problem we address is that learning and research (in the humanities) are hindered by a lack of coding skills and the seeming incommensurability of educating massive groups of students and providing high quality education. Although traditional knowledge institutions are losing their monopoly on education and research, ICT skills and knowledge production remain privileges of a cultural, technological and economic elite.

We propose to tackle this problem by providing online and offline interfaces between people on the one hand and learning and research on the other hand, which focus on new forms of collaboration and a user- and tool-oriented approach to learning programming skills. These interfaces lower the technological, economic and organizational barriers to participation, empower many different groups of people to more deeply and effectively engage with technology and motivate lifelong learning.

Within digital humanities research a broad range of tools is used for
analysis of digital materials. Humanities scholars often have little
interest in the details of how the tools work, but prefer to focus on
what they can be used for. However, understanding the intricate details
of tools is important when drawing conclusions from and basing claims on
their results.

In collaborative projects with computer scienctist, the latter have
more interest in those details, but may lack the domain expertise
to understand the full consequences of implementation details for
humanities research At the University of Amsterdam, we are currently
developing a collaborative platform for building and reflecting on
humanities tools through programming.

In this project we investigate ways to develop this platform in which
collaboration learning and research is intuitive and effective. The goal
of this project is to get humanities and computer science perspective
to inform, enrich and enhance each other. 

The importance of this platform, however, is not limited to mere use.
It allows to explore what forms of (collaborative) interaction models
programming opens up (see user interaction models, Bradley, 2004). We
will also investigate about how scholarly primitives (Unsworth, 2002)
can better guide the development and investigation of tools.

How can the (self)critical reflection of the humanities be brought
to bear on programming solutions? And how can programming enhance
reflection on tools and their use for humanities research aims to
create an expandable platform for humanities students and scholars to
collaboratively learn programming and build tools for their research.

In order to initiate a fruitful debate about the use of coding in
the humanities it is crucial to substantially increase the degree of
digital literacy. It is our conviction, that people that do not know
how to read and write code are not truly digitally literate. Therefore
education should play an important role in the formation of a center for
humanities and technology.

However, the past has taught us that this cannot work in a missionary
way, where the students were addressed as primitives. On the contrary,
we believe that coding education should evolve around users and their
needs. Thus one of the main challenges to face for the creation of a
sustainable dialogue about the opportunities ICT offers is to interest
and educate non-technologically biased persons, meaning those who are
not motivated by technology in and of itself, but want to know how it
can contribute to their needs before investing in it. This perspective
often lacks from standard coding courses and tutorials.


### How this research contributes to the humanities, and to ‘digital humanities’ 

The contribution of the development and research of this
platform contributes to the humanities and digital humanities in several
ways. Developing programming skills will lead DH scholars to better
understand their digital tools and results, thereby allowing them to
make more reliable and meaningful interpretations. Research on tool building will lead to better models of and guidelines for how to develop tools around a specific research question. Humanities scholars can communicate more easily and clearly with computer scientists and collaborate more intuitively through a shared vocabulary (coding), i.e. reducing friction at the interface between two domains. Through collaborative projects, new tools will be developed that can be used and modified for further research. Humanities scholars will learn a skill that is valued outside the confines of the university, thereby increasing both their employability as well as their
ability to engage in public-private partnerships. In times of big data, more and more information is available but not necessary turned into knowledge. The Coding the Humanities platform
  educates students, researchers and non-technologically biased people on
  how to approach this data. It allows its participants to gain insights
  by addressing these datasets. The CtH projects and tools are therefore
  easily relateable to already existing open data movements - it seeks to
  provide its users with digital agency that evolves into debates on open
  data.


### Relation to ‘Opportunities for the humanities’ section of the white paper

The platform provides students and scholars in the humanities with the
tools to create new ways to communicate their research interactively.
It develops new tools that include options for multiple categorization,
making classification systems maliable to new discoveries and points of
view.

Organizational opportunities: the platform will foster new forms of
collaborations between scholars of different humanities disciplines and
between humanities and computer science.



### How this research contributes to one or more of the core technologies in section 1 of the white paper 

Programming underlies all five core technological challenges and a
diverse group of researchers collaboration on projects on the platform
will cover the whole range of technical challenges and all areas of the
humanities.

The strong focus on reflection of humanities scholars and their deep
understanding of and multiple perspective on the complexities of their
materials can inform the building of tools related to each of the core
technologies.

Coding the Humanities projects are produced and stored under open licenses, which encourages the collaboration and reuse of the software tools by other institutions, companies or partners. In this sense, the platform triggers direct debate on the status of ICT in the humanities.


## How does this research build on relevant state-of-the-art research?

One of the premisses of this project is that there is hardly any state-of-the-art research on this topic. The digital tools that are used in humanities
research are hardly ever made into a topic of discussion or reflection. The building of new
custom made tools, such as the platform that we suggest, is even more rare. Companies
offering online learning platforms like Apearo, Edx have no courses in
this direction. There are programming courses offered for non-computer
science students, but they often engage students with technical
jargon and a perspective that lacks relevance to those with no such
technological bias but a need to know what programming skills have to
offer them. 

That being said, our project does build on some pioneering work by people such
as Stefan Sinclair (McGill), John Willinsky (Stanford), Alan Liu (University of
Santa Barbara), Geoff Bowker (UC Irvine), and Siva Vaidhyanathan (University of
Virginia), all of which are involved as advisors in our project.




### Why the proposed research team would be the best to perform this research:

This research is extremely new, and we are leaders in our pursuit of this coding platform. At Coding the Humanities, we have developed three courses in coding for humanities students, two of which are already running and one which will begin in September 2014. We have also organized and given a workshop EXPLAIN MORE?. In effect we have begun to develop a platform and see the great potential for what can be achieved if we can expand it. Jan Hein Hoogstad has a phenomenal background both in the humanities fields of Cultural Analysis and Literature, as well as in programming. Marijn Koolen has developed expertise in Artificial Intelligence, information retrieval, and information science, making him an ideal fit for this project. Robin Boast has worked in the digital humanities for over 30 years and currently teaches on Cultural Information Science, Neo-colonial information governance, and the history and sociology of digitally and collecting. Sabrina Sauer is an Assistant Professor at the University of Amsterdam. Her research has included examining what happens when the ideas of ordinary people become the starting point for the design of new ICT’s, and this platform pulls previously uninvolved humanities people into ICT's. Joris van Zundert, researcher and developer at the KNAW, manages project Aflab. This project determine the requirements of a digital infrastructure for humanities and to explore and test drive the possibilities of computational humanities for that field, relating directly to this project.


### Plans for software and data management and sharing

The platform will embrace open source culture and all contributions to
the platform and projects developed on the platform are published using
open licenses. The students share their code projects on distributed
repositories, which encourages re-use, altering and further development.

#### Key Deliverables
The platform for collaborative humanities research through programming that this project will develop is in itself a key deliverable. The platform will create new libraries for tool building, as well as tools and guidelines / best practices for collaboration. 

### Collaboration Plan

#### Valorization

Programming underlies all five core technological challenges and a
diverse group of researchers collaboration on projects on the platform
will cover the whole range of technical challenges and all areas of the
humanities.

#### Societal and economic benefits:

The platform is developed to be inclusive. People who are reluctant to
engage with technology in research because of the technologically biased
approach of most trainings will find a more inviting humanities-oriented
approach to learning those skills. Knowledge of programming and better
models of collaboration reduces the power of the elite over the rest.
 
#### Teaching and training benefits:
The platform is used directly to train staff of the CHAT partners. Partners from different backgrounds and disciplines learn to communicate better through a shared vocabulary by learning to program and develop their research projects on the platform. This also leads to better visibility of who does what and a stronger, more connected, network for collaboration among the CHAT partners. 

#### Contribution to long-term development of CHAT:
The platform will create a pool of young, technically proficient humanities scholars, and humanities-informed computer/information science students who would be familiar with and well-connected to CHAT as an excellent network to further their research careers.
