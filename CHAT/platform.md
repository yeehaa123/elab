## Project Description 

### Main Research Question 

This project explores how coding can open up innovative types
of learning and research in the humanities.  

### Goal and Problem

This project aims to stimulate engagement with and reflection on digital
tools in the humanities. The problem we address is that learning and
research are hindered by a lack of coding skills and the seeming
incommensurability of educating massive groups of students and providing
high quality education. Although traditional knowledge institutions are
losing their monopoly on education and research, both coding skills and
an academic education remain privileges of a cultural, technological and
economic elite.

We propose to tackle this problem by providing online and offline
interfaces between people on the one hand and learning and research
on the other hand, which focus on new forms of collaboration and a
user- and tool-oriented approach to learning programming skills. These
interfaces lower the technological, economic and organizational barriers
to participation, empower many different groups of people to more deeply
and effectively engage with technology and motivate lifelong learning.

Within digital humanities research a broad range of tools is used for
analysis of digital materials. Scholars often have little interest in
the details of how the tools work, but prefer to focus on what they
can be used for. However, understanding the intricate details of tools
is important when drawing conclusions from and basing claims on their
results.

In collaborative projects with computer scienctist, the latter have
more interest in those details, but may lack the domain expertise
to understand the full consequences of implementation details for
humanities research.

In this project we investigate ways to develop this platform in which
collaboration learning and research is intuitive and effective. The goal
of this project is to get humanities and computer science perspective
to inform, enrich and enhance each other. We aim to educate a generation 
of hybrid scholars and computer scientists that embody high end skills 
of both worlds.

The importance of this platform, however, is not limited to mere use.
It allows to explore what forms of (collaborative) interaction models
programming opens up (see user interaction models, Bradley, 2004). We
will also investigate about how scholarly primitives (Unsworth, 2002)
can better guide the development and investigation of tools.

How can the (self)critical reflection of the humanities be brought
to bear on programming solutions? And how can programming enhance
reflection on tools and their use for humanities research aims to
create an expandable platform for humanities students and scholars to
collaboratively learn programming and build tools for their research.

In order to initiate a fruitful debate about the use of coding in
the humanities it is crucial to substantially increase the degree of
digital literacy. It is our conviction that people that do not know
how to read and write code are not truly digitally literate. Therefore
education should play an important role in the formation of a center for
humanities and technology.

However, the past has taught us that this cannot work in a missionary
way, where the students were addressed as primitives. On the contrary,
we believe that coding education should evolve around users and their
needs. Thus one of the main challenges to face for the creation of
a sustainable dialogue about the opportunities technology offers is
to interest and educate non-technologically biased persons, meaning
those who are not motivated by technology in and of itself, but want to
know how it can contribute to their needs before investing in it. This
perspective often lacks from standard coding courses and tutorials.


### How this research contributes to the humanities, and to ‘digital humanities’ 

Developing programming skills will lead DH scholars to better understand
their tools and results, thereby allowing them to make more reliable
and meaningful interpretations. Research on tool building will lead
to better models of and guidelines for how to develop tools around a
specific research question.

Humanities scholars can communicate more easily and clearly with
computer scientists and collaborate more intuitively through a shared
vocabulary (coding), i.e. reducing friction at the interface between two
domains. Through collaborative projects, tools will be developed that
can be used and modified for further research. Scholars will
learn a skill that is valued outside the confines of the university,
thereby increasing both their employability as well as their ability to
engage in public-private partnerships. 

In times of big data, more and more information is available but not
necessary turned into knowledge.The Coding the Humanities platform
educates students, researchers and non-technologically biased people on
how to approach this data. It allows its participants to gain insights
by addressing these datasets. The CtH projects and tools are therefore
easily relateable to already existing open data movements - it seeks to
provide its users with digital agency that evolves into debates on open
data.


### Relation to ‘Opportunities for the humanities’ section of the white paper

The platform provides students and scholars in the humanities with the
tools to create new ways to communicate their research interactively.
It develops new tools that include options for multiple categorization,
making classification systems maliable to new discoveries and points of
view.

Organizational opportunities: the platform will foster new forms of
collaborations between scholars of different humanities disciplines and
between humanities and computer science.


### How this research contributes to one or more of the core technologies in section 1 of the white paper 

Programming underlies all five core technological challenges and a
diverse group of researchers collaboration on projects on the platform
will cover the whole range of technical challenges and all areas of the
humanities.

The strong focus on reflection of humanities scholars and their deep
understanding of and multiple perspective on the complexities of their
materials can inform the building of tools related to each of the core
technologies.

Coding the Humanities projects are produced and stored under open
licenses, which encourages the collaboration and reuse of the software
tools by other institutions, companies or partners. In this sense,
the platform triggers direct debate on the use of technology in the
humanities.


### How does this research build on relevant state-of-the-art research?

One of the premisses of this project is that there is little
state-of-the-art research on this topic. The digital tools that are used
in humanities research are rarely topic of discussion or reflection.
The building of custom made tools is even more rare. Companies
offering online learning platforms like Apearo, Edx have no courses
or software in this direction. There are programming courses offered
for non-computer science students, but they often engage students with
technical jargon and a perspective that lacks relevance to those with no
such technological bias but a need to know what programming skills have
to offer them.

That being said, our project does build on some pioneering work by
people such as Stefan Sinclair (McGill), John Willinsky (Stanford), Alan
Liu (University of Santa Barbara), Geoff Bowker (UC Irvine), and Siva
Vaidhyanathan (University of Virginia), all of which are involved as
advisors in our project.


### Why the proposed research team would be the best to perform this research:

Our project team has a broad range of expertise on programming,
software development, pedagogy, and our research covers several
humanities disciplines, including Cultural Analysis, Literary Studies,
Heritage Studies and Mediastudies as well as Computer and Information
Science.

A pilot version of this project (platform and two courses, staff
courses) is already under active development and is co-funded by the UVA
and VU.

Joris van Zundert led the European COST Action 'Interedition' on
international collaborative tool development and interoperability in
the humanities. He studies the interaction between computer science,
software development, and humanities.

Jan Hein Hoogstad has a background in Philosophy, Mediastudies,
Cultural Analysis and Literature, and has taught programming at Dev
BootCamp in San Francisco.

Marijn Koolen is Assistant Professor in Digital Humanities, has a
background in Artificial Intelligence and information science.

Robin Boast has worked in the digital humanities for over 30 years and
currently teaches information governance, and the history and sociology
of digitally and collecting.

Sabrina Sauer is Assistant Professor at the University of
Amsterdam. Her research focus on the innovative contributions of
everyday users on platforms such as this one.

Nynke Bos is Assistant Professor at the University of Amsterdam. She
is a psychologist with significant experience in pedagogy, ideal for a
platform that creates new ways of learning.


### Plans for software and data management and sharing

The platform will embrace open source culture and all contributions to
the platform and projects developed on the platform are published using
a open-source (MIT) license. The students share their code projects on
distributed repositories, which encourages re-use, altering and further
development.

### Key Deliverables

The platform for collaborative humanities research through programming
that this project will develop is in itself a key deliverable. The
platform will create new libraries for tool building, as well as tools
and guidelines / best practices for collaboration.

## Publishing and distribution

PhDs and post-docs will publish for conferences, as well as in adacemic journals.

## Project Management

The platform will be coordinated by Jan Hein Hoogstad and Joris van
Zundert, who will serve as the Principle Investigators for the UvA and
the KNAW respectively.

## Valorization

Programming underlies all five core technological challenges and a
diverse group of researchers collaboration on projects on the platform
will cover the whole range of technical challenges and all areas of the
humanities.

### Societal and economic benefits:

The platform is developed to be inclusive. People who are reluctant to
engage with technology in research because of the technologically biased
approach of most trainings will find a more inviting humanities-oriented
approach to learning those skills. Knowledge of programming and better
models of collaboration reduces the power of the elite over the rest.
 
### Teaching and training benefits:

The platform is used directly to train staff of the CHAT partners.
Partners from different backgrounds and disciplines learn to communicate
better through a shared vocabulary by learning to program and develop
their research projects on the platform. This also leads to better
visibility of who does what and a stronger, more connected, network for
collaboration among the CHAT partners.

### Contribution to long-term development of CHAT:

The platform will create a pool of young, technically proficient
humanities scholars, and humanities-informed computer/information
science students who would be familiar with and well-connected to CHAT
as an excellent network to further their research careers.
