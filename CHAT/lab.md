## Project description

### Main Research Question

How can we design an on- and offline lab that is optimized for the
demands of embedded researchers, so that this new type of research is
no longer physically and discursively marginalized, and can lead to
productive and sustainable partnerships between universities and the
private sector?

### Goal and problem

The goal is to accelerate the process of opening universities toward
other universities, civic movements, and companies by creating a space
situated between the involved actors. The “living lab” we propose
shows how this can lead to innovation. The challenge to be addressed is
forming a community both on and offline whose participants are to engage
with a platform over a longer period of time and to actively contribute
to sustainable projects. The Lab as Interface project addresses this
challenge by designing and producing an offline living lab as interface
between digital and analogue worlds.


### How this research contributes to the humanities, and to ‘digital humanities’? How does the research relate to the ‘opportunities for the humanities’ identified in the White Paper, Section 1?

The foreseen living lab focuses on facilitating breakthrough scholarship
in the (digital) humanities, by offering a collaborative platform that
embraces social learning practices between public-private-civic actors.

This living lab, the OverLab, will explore the integration and
complementation of ICT based learning and collaboration into an offline
environment. It will serve as a real life testbed to initiate, support
and foster online ICT projects. At the same time, the strategies and
practices of the analogue space inform the development of the digital
platform. Innovative perspectives on the application of ICT in general
and its integration into an offline space will be explored through
experimental, user focused workshops that result in a physical space.
The conception and design of the lab according to user needs is a
crucial part within this subproject. This approach will produce models
and concepts for the design and user culture of a living lab that
feeds off of and informs the online learning platform. The process
will be openly documented and intends the imitation and formation of
living labs related to the coding the humanities platform. As such,
the OverLab brings together public-private-civic partners to develop
new computational instruments as well as research methods; in addition
to this, the embedded researchers’ activities who are of the OverLab
set-up help articulate and map how developed instruments and methods
form new models and methods for sustainable cooperation so as to extend
the developed practices. This will culminate in new areas of enquiry
for humanities’ research; bringing forth humanities’ perspectives
and research about larger societal and R&D inspired collaboration and
ICT innovation practices. The OverLab furthermore allows embedded
researchers who work between theory and (artistic) practice, physical
and digital research, science and art, universities and public or
private partners. Furthermore, within the OverLab humanities’ scholars
can experiment with digital humanites and digital methods thereby
improving awareness of computational instruments as well as increasing a
space to meet possible private partners for future research.




## How this research relates to the ‘opportunities for the humanities’ in the White Paper:

Core technology identified in section 2 of the white paper:
- visualization
visualization and machine learning: within the OverLab, students and researchers collaborate to learn and experiment with data visualization, grappling with large open data sets provided by e.g. Europeana. The OverLab thus not only allows for experimentation, but also learning-by-doing collaboratively; digital interfaces are developed that are discovery oriented. The offline OverLab is complemented by an online platform (codingthehumanities) (weyeser text) (Question: is this too much overlap with the visualization interface proposal?)

## How does this research build on relevant state-of-the-art research

The living lab uses a user-driven methodology that blurs the boundaries between technology users and producers by including (future) users of technologies from the start of technology development. This inclusion reverses top-down R&D-processes in favour of bottom-up innovation, performed by users and grounded in society instead of in research laboratories. This practice is to lead to unexpected insights into user ideas and practices (Almirall, 2008: 43 Almirall, E. (2008). Living Labs and Open Innovation: Roles and Applicability. The Electronic Journal for Virtual Organizations and Networks, 10 (August), 21–46). and lead to the development of more successful ICTs. To gain unexpected insights, methodologies focus on the inclusion of real (end) users in daily life contexts. The Living Lab thus also comprises a setting; a setting that affords “experimentation environments in which technology is given shape in real life context and in which (end) users are considered co-producers” (Ballon et al., 2005: 13 Ballon, P., Delaere, S., Pierson, J., M, P., Slot, M., Bierhof, J., & Diocaretz, M. (2005). Test & Experimentation Platforms for Broadband Innovation: Conceptualizing and Benchmarking International Best Practice).
This research builds on recent insights in collaborative living lab practices (B. Dutilleul, F. A. J. Birrer, and W. Mensink, Unpacking European Living Labs: Analysing Innovation’s Social Dimensions, Central European Journal of Public Policy, vol. 4, no. 1, pp. 60-85, 2010., A. Følstad, Living Labs for Innovation and Development of Information and Communication Technology: A Literature Overview, The Electronic Journal for Virtual Organisations and Networks, Special Issue on Living Labs, vol. 10, pp. 99-131, 2008. Sauer, S. (September 2013) User innovativeness in Living Laboratories – Everyday user improvisations with ICTs as a source of innovation. PhD Thesis, University of Twente. Promotor: Prof. dr. N.E.J. Oudshoorn) where the importance of user-centered research in living labs is underlined, but that also underlines that more research about the actual role of “the user” (in this case, the humanities’ scholar) is required in order to more fully embrace the advantages of on and offline collaborative practices. The OverLab provides exactly such an opportunity.
