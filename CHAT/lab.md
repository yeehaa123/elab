## Project description

### Main Research Question

How can we design an on- and offline lab that is optimized for the
demands of embedded researchers, so that this new type of research is
no longer physically and discursively marginalized, and can lead to
productive and sustainable partnerships between universities and the
private sector?

### Goal and problem

The goal is to accelerate the process of opening universities towards
private partners, cultural institutions, civic movements, and other
universities by creating a physical space situated between the involved
agents.

The challenge that needs to be overcome is forming a community both
on- and offline whose participants engage with a platform over
a longer period of time and to actively contribute to sustainable
projects. 'The Lab as Interface' project addresses this challenge by
designing and producing an offline living lab as interface between
the digital and other worlds.

A lab for embedded research makes digital humanities' projects more sustainable and pushes them beyond the academic borders to engage private partners, civic organisations and the general public. This alternative circulation of
knowledge leads to new forms and practices of research.

### How this research contributes to the humanities, and to ‘digital humanities’? 

The recent focus of funding for the humanities towards creative
industries and other private partners has resulted in many digital
humanities projects with embedded researchers. This project encourages
embedded researchers to collaborate and learn from each others'
experiences, to bring together knowledge on how to best combine academic
research, product innovation and commercial interests. This results in
new forms of knowledge production in the humanities, and builds sustainable
collaborations between embedded researchers.
Through experience, this research will reveal best practices of setting up embedded research projects,
and ensures that embedded humanities research is neither too academically oriented nor too product oriented.

### How the research relates to the ‘opportunities for the humanities’ identified in the White Paper, Section 1?

The proposed living lab focuses on facilitating breakthrough scholarship
in the (digital) humanities, by offering a collaborative platform that
embraces social learning practices between public-private-civic actors.
This lab explores the integration and augmentation of online
learning and collaboration into an offline environment. It serves as
a real life testbed to initiate, support and foster online humanities
ICT projects. At the same time, the strategies and practices of the
physical space of the lab inform the development of the digital platform. 

Innovative perspectives on the application of technology in general
and its integration into an offline space will be explored through
experimental, user focused workshops that result in a physical space.
The conception and design of the lab according to user needs is a
crucial part within this subproject. This approach will produce
models and concepts for the design and user culture of a living
lab that feeds off of and informs the online learning platform.

The process will be openly documented and intends the imitation
and formation of living labs related to the coding the [humanities
platform](http://codingthehumanities.com/) (part of the joint UvA-VU initiatives to further Digital Humanities research and education). 
As such, our lab brings together public-private-civic
partners to develop new computational instruments as well as research
methods. 

In addition to this, the embedded researchers’ activities articulate
and map how developed instruments and methods form new models and
methods for sustainable cooperation.This culminates in new areas
of enquiry for humanities’ research; bringing forth humanities’ perspectives and research about
larger societal and R&D inspired collaboration and ICT innovation
practices. The lab also allows embedded researchers to
work between theory and (artistic) practice, physical and digital
research, science and art, universities and public or private partners.
Furthermore, in the lab humanities’ scholars experiment with digital humanities and methods
thereby improving awareness of computational instruments while also using the space to meet
new partners for future research.


## How this research contributes to one or more of the core technologies in White Paper, Section 2

**visualization and machine learning**: within the lab, students
and researchers collaborate to learn and experiment with data
visualization, grappling with large open data sets provided by
e.g. Europeana. The embedded research lab thus not only allows
for experimentation, but also learning-by-doing collaboratively;
digital interfaces are developed that are discovery oriented. The
offline lab is complemented by an online platform ([Coding the
Humanities](http://codingthehumanities.com/)). 

## How this research builds on relevant state-of-the-art research

The living lab uses a user-driven methodology that blurs the boundaries
between technology users and producers by including (future) users of
technologies from the start of technology development. This inclusion
reverses top-down R&D-processes in favour of bottom-up innovation,
performed by users and grounded in society instead of in research
laboratories. This practice is to lead to unexpected insights into user
ideas and practices and lead to the development of more successful ICTs. To gain unexpected insights,
methodologies focus on the inclusion of real (end) users in daily life
contexts. The Living Lab thus also comprises a setting; a setting that
affords experimentation environments,with users as co-producers.

This research builds on recent insights in collaborative living lab
practices (Sauer, S. (September 2013) User innovativeness in Living Laboratories – Everyday user
improvisations with ICTs as a source of innovation. PhD Thesis,
University of Twente. Promotor: Prof. dr. N.E.J. Oudshoorn) where the
importance of user-centered research in living labs is underlined, but
that also stresses how more research about the actual role of “the
user” (in this case, the humanities’ scholar) is required in order
to more fully embrace the advantages of on- and offline collaborative
practices. The lab provides exactly such an opportunity.

The CLUE team "Paradigms of Creativity" at the VU University researches expressions of creativity in everyday life and in artistic production, within their specific historic, institutional and societal contexts. Analyzing creativity's embeddedness in changing relations between digital and physical communities relates directly to the role of this project's embedded researcher.

Our private partner in this project, The Dark
Horse GMBH., is one of the leading European consultancy firms in design
thinking. We believe the user-centered, collaborative approach that
defines this methodology, is a way out of the individualist research
culture in the humanities. DH will help us design a lab and a curriculum
based on this approach.


## Why this research team would be best to perform this research

Sabrina Sauer is a prominent researcher at the University of Amsterdam,
with specific expertise on living labs. 

Jan Hein Hoogstad is Assistant Professor in Cultural Analysis
and Comparative Literature who has also taught coding bootcamps and
workshops, including at Dev Bootcamp in San Francisco. 

Marijn Koolen, Assistant Professor in the digital humanities at the
University of Amsterdam, specializes in user studies and user needs, and
this project is aimed at finding and creating what products and services would most benefit users. Along with Sabrina Sauer and Jan Hein Hoogstad, Marijn Koolen has a background in media studies. 

Johanna Barnbeck is an Embedded Artistic Researcher who has worked as a
creative consultant, making her ideal for a project that links academic
and non-academic worlds.

Nynke Bos is an expert in ICT innovation. 

Robin Boast has been working for over thirty years in what today we call
Digital Humanities. His work has focused on diverse topics, ranging from
the first digital collection projects in museums and universities to the
more recent emergence of the Web and social computing, to the question
of digitality itself.

Ginette Verstraete, Professor at the VU University, researches the way
mobile (location-based) technologies and their applications (such as
GPS on iPhones) have transformed mobility through urban space. These
sociotechnical transformations raise new substantive issues for the
study of movement in cities, but also for a humanities-based study of
media usage.

Both the UvA and VU have and are developing Humanities research labs 
This project also connects to the development of the Coding the Humanities 
platform, which is developed by the applicants.

Dark Horse is a company that works in Design Thinking, which is central
to the lab.

post-doc will especially write articles on new forms of valorizing
humanities research. There will also be prototypes developed and models
created for embedded research labs.

## publish/distribute results

Results will be published in academic journals, conferences, workshops,
and colloquiums.

## Collaboration Plan
The Principle Investigators will be Robin Boast from the University of Amsterdam and Ginette Verstraete from the VU University. They will coordinate the collaboration plan. Periodical meetings will take place involving the partners and Dark Horse.

## Valorization

## Expected societal and economic benefits

The concrete deliverables will be the creation of new products and
services for public-private-civic benefit. This research will gain
insight in how collaborations in online and offline spaces enrich each
other. It will also develop new research methodologies. Assigning a role
of embedded researcher will be of interest to academia as well as to
private partners.


## Teaching and training benefits

The establishment of the lab as collaborative space allows users to
train and learn from each other. This also benefits the development
digital humanities' skillset and experimentation for future digital
humanities' scholars. In addition, the learning-by-doing approach helps
overcome the reluctance of reflectively minded scholars to engage
with new technologies. Embedded researchers work between theory and
(artistic) practice, physical and digital research, science and art,
universities and public or private partners. Their needs as digital
knowledge worker on the one hand and a specific but homogeneous group on
the other hand, allow valuable insights concerning the question of how
ICT can provide instruments to make research more open, accessible and
sustainable. This project will circulate knowledge; it will articulate
how tacit knowledge informs humanities' research through direct
collaboration between different actors to enrich research experience.


## How the project relates to the long term development of CHAT

This project contributes to knowledge about public-private-civic
collaboration practices and how these may be (re)modeled to benefit or
learn from user-centricity. It has an explicit inclusion of humanities'
researchers to inform and question ICT developments, in open online and
offline environments.
