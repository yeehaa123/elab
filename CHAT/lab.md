## Project description

### Main Research Question

How can we design an on- and offline lab that is optimized for the
demands of embedded researchers, so that this new type of research is
no longer physically and discursively marginalized, and can lead to
productive and sustainable partnerships between universities and the
private sector?

### Goal and problem

The goal is to accelerate the process of opening universities towards
private partners, cultural institutions, civic movements, and other
universities by creating a space situated between the involved agents.
The 'living lab' that we propose shows how this can lead to innovation.

The challenge that needs to be overcome is forming a community both
on- and offline whose participants are to engage with a platform over
a longer period of time and to actively contribute to sustainable
projects. 'The Lab as Interface' project addresses this challenge by
designing and producing an offline living lab as interface between
the digital and other worlds.


### How this research contributes to the humanities, and to ‘digital humanities’? 

The recent focus of funding for the humanities towards creative industries and other private partners has resulted in many digital humanities projects with embedded researchers. This project encourages embedded researchers to collaborate and learn from each others experiences, to bring together knowledge on how to best combine academic research, product innovation and commercial interests. This results in new forms of knowledge production in the humanities. 

### How does the research relate to the ‘opportunities for the humanities’ identified in the White Paper, Section 1?

The proposed living lab focuses on facilitating breakthrough scholarship
in the (digital) humanities, by offering a collaborative platform that
embraces social learning practices between public-private-civic actors.

This lab will explore the integration and augmentation of online
learning and collaboration into an offline environment. It will serve as
a real life testbed to initiate, support and foster online humanities
ICT projects. At the same time, the strategies and practices of the
physical space in which the lab is located inform the development
of the digital platform. 

Innovative perspectives on the application of technology in general
and its integration into an offline space will be explored through
experimental, user focused workshops that result in a physical space.
The conception and design of the lab according to user needs is a
crucial part within this subproject. This approach will produce
models and concepts for the design and user culture of a living
lab that feeds off of and informs the online learning platform.

The process will be openly documented and intends the imitation
and formation of living labs related to the coding the [humanities
platform](http://codingthehumanities.com/) (currently in development
at the UvA). As such, our lab brings together public-private-civic
partners to develop new computational instruments as well as research
methods. 

In addition to this, the embedded researchers’ activities articulate
and map how developed instruments and methods form new models and
methods for sustainable cooperation so as to extend the developed
practices. This will culminate in new areas of enquiry for humanities’
research; bringing forth humanities’ perspectives and research about
larger societal and R&D inspired collaboration and ICT innovation
practices. The lab furthermore allows embedded researchers who
work between theory and (artistic) practice, physical and digital
research, science and art, universities and public or private partners.
Furthermore, within the OverLab humanities’ scholars can experiment
with digital humanites and digital methods thereby improving awareness
of computational instruments as well as increasing a space to meet
possible private partners for future research.


## How this research contributes to one or more of the core technologies in section 1 of the white paper 


*visualization and machine learning*: within the lab, students and
researchers collaborate to learn and experiment with data visualization,
grappling with large open data sets provided by e.g. Europeana.
The embedded research lab thus not only allows for experimentation, but also
learning-by-doing collaboratively; digital interfaces are developed that
are discovery oriented. The offline lab is complemented by an online
platform ([Coding the Humanities](http://codingthehumanities.com/)) (weyeser text) (Question: is this too
much overlap with the visualization interface proposal?)

## How does this research build on relevant state-of-the-art research

The living lab uses a user-driven methodology that blurs the boundaries
between technology users and producers by including (future) users of
technologies from the start of technology development. This inclusion
reverses top-down R&D-processes in favour of bottom-up innovation,
performed by users and grounded in society instead of in research
laboratories. This practice is to lead to unexpected insights into user
ideas and practices (Almirall, 2008: 43 Almirall, E. (2008). Living Labs
and Open Innovation: Roles and Applicability. The Electronic Journal for
Virtual Organizations and Networks, 10 (August), 21–46). and lead to
the development of more successful ICTs. To gain unexpected insights,
methodologies focus on the inclusion of real (end) users in daily life
contexts. The Living Lab thus also comprises a setting; a setting that
affords “experimentation environments in which technology is given
shape in real life context and in which (end) users are considered
co-producers” (Ballon et al., 2005: 13 Ballon, P., Delaere, S.,
Pierson, J., M, P., Slot, M., Bierhof, J., & Diocaretz, M. (2005). Test
& Experimentation Platforms for Broadband Innovation: Conceptualizing
and Benchmarking International Best Practice).

This research builds on recent insights in collaborative living lab
practices (B. Dutilleul, F. A. J. Birrer, and W. Mensink, Unpacking

2013) User innovativeness in Living Laboratories – Everyday user
improvisations with ICTs as a source of innovation. PhD Thesis,

importance of user-centered research in living labs is underlined, but
that also underlines that more research about the actual role of “the
user” (in this case, the humanities’ scholar) is required in order
to more fully embrace the advantages of on- and offline collaborative
practices. The OverLab provides exactly such an opportunity.


## Why this research team would be best to perform this research

Sabrina Sauer is a prominent researcher at the University of Amsterdam, with specific expertise on living labs. Johanna Barnbeck is an Embedded Artistic Researcher who has worked as a creative consultant, making her ideal for a project that links academic and non-academic worlds. Jan Hein Hoogstad is an Assistant Professor in Cultural Analysis and Comparative Literature who has also taught coding bootcamps and workshops, including at the Dev Bootcamp in San Francisco. Marijn Koolen, an Assistant Professor in the digital humanities at the University of Amsterdam, specializes in user studies and user needs, and this project is aimed at finding what tools would most benefit users and then creating them. All three of the above have backgrounds in media studies. Nynke Bos is an expert in ICT innovation. Ginette Verstraete ... ... ... Robin Boast has been working for over thirty years in what today we call Digital Humanities. His work has focused on diverse topics, ranging from the first digital collection projects in museums and universities to the more recent emergence of the Web and social computing, to the question of digitality itself. Partiipants from the University of Amsterdam are currently developing a lab at their university as well as the coding platform, which links to this lab project. Dark Horse is a company that works in Design Thinking, which is central to the lab.

+ VU expertise

<!--- Brings together experts in the field – living lab research, digital humanities scholars, programmers and developers, artists, embedded researchers, to collaborate?? SOMETHING LIKE THIS?? --->

## budget: 

- 2 PhD's
- embedded researcher

## key deliverables:

The research deliverables for this will be published papers and presentations at conferences for the PhD and post-doc researchers. The post-doc will especially write articles on new forms of valorizing humanities research. There will also be protypes developed and models created for embedded research labs. 

## publish/distribute results

Results will be published in academic journals, conferences, workshops, and colloquiums.

## Valorization

## Expected societal and economic benefits

The concrete deliverables will be the creation of new products and services for public-private-civic benefit. This research will gain insight in how collaborations in online and offline spaces enrich each other. It will also develop new research methodologies. Assigning a role of embedded researcher will be of interest to academia as well as to private partners.


## Teaching and training benefits

The establishment of OverLab as collaborative space allows users to train and learn from each other. This also benefits the development digital humanities' skillset and experimentation for future digital humanities' scholars. In addition, the learning-by-doing approach helps overcome the reluctance of relfectively minded scholars to engage with new technologies. Embedded researchers work between theory and (artistic) practice, physical and digital research, science and art, universities and public or private partners. Their needs as digital knowledge worker on the one hand and a specific but homogeneous group on the other hand, allow valuable insights concerning the question of how ICT can provide instruments to make research more open, accessible and sustainable. This project will circulate knowledge; it will articulate how tacit knowledge informs humanities' research through direct collaboration between different actors to enrich research experience.


## How the project relates to the long term development of CHAT
This project contributes to knowledge about public-private-civic collaboration practices and how these may be (re)modeled to benefit or learn from user-centricity. It has an explcit inclusion of humanities' researchers to inform and question ICT developments, in open online and offline environments.
