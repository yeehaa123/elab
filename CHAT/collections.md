## Project Description

### Main Research Question:

How can cultural and governmental data sets (API's) be transformed into
new kinds of collections that are no longer intrinsically linked to the
original objects and the institutions in which they are displayed?

### Goal and problem:

The goal of this research is to create an international exhibition
that combines on and offline projects. We aim to involve students and
researchers from the Platform as Interface, as well as other researchers
and developers. This exhibition will consist of workshops, data events,
speakers, art installations, and presentations on relationship between
ICT, art, business, and cultural heritage.

There are not only dramatic geographic differences in accessibility
to and user skills of ICT but also socio-economic and demographic
gaps.1 Vast societal groups face the problem of digital exclusion.
Accessibility to and digital literacy about ICTs determine whether a
person is included into economic, social and cultural life, and whether
they can participate in decision making processes within the democratic
realm. In other words, using and comprehending ICT is about agency and
inclusion. With regard to the growing impact of ICT not only on economic
productivity but also within the cultural, social and political realm,
this exclusion forms a challenge in terms of equality, inclusion and
chances of participation.

One area in which the challenge of digital literacy and exclusion is
prominent is within humanities research. Academia is increasingly
confronted with large amounts of data. In order to turn this data
into information and into knowledge, researchers and students need
tools that allow to structure, search, correlate, analyze, but most
importantly, present and visualize this data. This is also true for
working fields related to the humanities: museums, libraries and
archives are challenged to make the huge data sets that result from
digitalization of the cultural heritage they foster2, accessible and
understandable for as many people as possible. Despite the opportunities
these mass resources generated in numerous digitization projects
provide, humanities researchers and students are – due to a lack of
skills - reluctant to exploit these troves.

### how this research contributes to core technologies identified in section 2 white paper:

- visualization

At the same time, governments, municipalities and cultural institutions
increasingly share their data openly online. A good example of this
development in the field of cultural heritage is our partner in this
project the Europeana network3. But also in the political field a lot
of open data sets wait be explored by dedicated citizen. The skills
to compile graspable information from big data sets therefore become
more important on the level of politics and social agency. It allows
civic movements but also single citizens to understand political and
social processes, identify problems and develop solutions – that can
be software based.4

### how the research relates to humanities, and ‘digital humanities’

### how the research relates to the ‘opportunities for the humanities’ section in the white paper:

### Budget:

- post-doc 
- PhD(s)?

### Deliverables:
 - exhibition / festival
 - models for new types of collaborative exhibitions
 - tools and libraries for data acquisition and manipulation
