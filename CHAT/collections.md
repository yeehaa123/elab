## Project Description

### Main Research Question:

How can cultural and governmental data sets (API's) be transformed into
new kinds of collections that are no longer intrinsically linked to the
original objects and the institutions in which they are displayed?

### Goal and problem:

The goal of this research is to create an international exhibition
that combines on and offline projects. We aim to involve students and
researchers that work on the 'coding the humanities' platform, but the
exhibition is also a possibility to attract others (artist, developers,
curators, etc.) to work with and on our platform.

The goal of this exhibition will be to create and display collections
that did not exist as such before. This is made possible by the fact
that many cultural institutions now make their collections publicly
available through so-called API's (Application Programming Interfaces).
In the events that we have planned, the participants are encouraged
to create and curate their own colllectons. In order to facilitate
this project, we will offer workshops, data events, speakers, art
installations, and presentations on relationship between technology,
art, business, and cultural heritage.

This entirely new kind of exhibition uses coding skills to make an
intervention in three areas that are crucial to the past, present, and
the future of the humanities: politics, literacy, and culture.

There are not only dramatic geographic differences in accessibility
to and user skills of ICT but also socio-economic and demographic
gaps.1 Vast societal groups face the problem of digital exclusion.
Accessibility to and digital literacy about ICTs determine whether a
person is included into economic, social and cultural life, and whether
they can participate in decision making processes within the democratic
realm. In other words, using and comprehending ICT is about agency and
inclusion. With regard to the growing impact of ICT not only on economic
productivity but also within the cultural, social and political realm,
this exclusion forms a challenge in terms of equality, inclusion and
chances of participation.

One area in which the challenge of digital literacy and exclusion is
prominent is within humanities research. Academia is increasingly
confronted with large amounts of data. In order to turn this data
into information and into knowledge, researchers and students need
tools that allow to structure, search, correlate, analyze, but most
importantly, present and visualize this data. 

The same argument also holds for working fields related to the humanities:
museums, libraries and archives are challenged to make the huge data
sets that result from digitalization of the cultural heritage they
foster, accessible and understandable for as many people as possible.
Despite the opportunities these mass resources generated in numerous
digitization projects provide, humanities researchers and students are
– due to a lack of skills - reluctant to exploit these troves.

Nonetheless, this project is not reducible to a political or didactic agenda.
Our primary goal is to show that APIs can lead to new forms of knowledge
production. By treating collections primarily as data sets, we believe that
the artworks, cultural artifacts, and policy documents can be recontextualized
in new and exciting ways. Thereby not only reconfiguring the relation between
the collection and the institution in which it is displayed, but also between 
the institutions amongst each other, their relation to the visitors/user, and 
finally, the user to the artwork.

### how this research contributes to core technologies identified in section 2 white paper:

- visualization

At the same time, governments, municipalities and cultural institutions
increasingly share their data openly online. A good example of this
development in the field of cultural heritage is our partner in this
project the Europeana network3. But also in the political field a lot
of open data sets wait be explored by dedicated citizen. The skills
to compile graspable information from big data sets therefore become
more important on the level of politics and social agency. It allows
civic movements but also single citizens to understand political and
social processes, identify problems and develop solutions – that can
be software based.4

### how the research relates to humanities, and ‘digital humanities’

### how the research relates to the ‘opportunities for the humanities’ section in the white paper:

### Budget:

- post-doc 
- PhD(s)?

### Deliverables:
 - exhibition / festival
 - models for new types of collaborative exhibitions
 - tools and libraries for data acquisition and manipulation

## How does this research build on relevant state-of-the-art research
