## Project Description

### Main Research Question:

How can cultural and governmental data sets (APIs) be transformed into
new kinds of collections that are no longer intrinsically linked to the
original objects and the institutions in which they are displayed?


### Goal and problem:

This research works towards a large international exhibition where
students, scholars, artists, developers, data scientists, and curators
collaborately create and display collection based upon publicly
available data sets. We aim to involve researchers that work on
the 'coding the humanities' platform, but the exhibition is also a
possibility to attract others (artist, developers, curators, etc.) to
work with and on our platform.

The goal of this exhibition will be to create and display collections
that did not exist as such before. This is made possible by the fact
that many cultural institutions now make their collections publicly
available through so-called API's (Application Programming Interfaces).
In the events that we have planned, the participants are encouraged
to create and curate their own collectons. To facilitate
this project, we will offer workshops, data events, speakers, art
installations, and presentations on relationships between technology,
art, business, and cultural heritage.

There are not only dramatic geographic differences in accessibility
to and user skills of coding but also socio-economic and demographic
gaps. Vast societal groups face the problem of digital exclusion.
Accessibility to and digital literacy about coding determine whether a
person is included into economic, social and cultural life, and whether
they can participate in decision making processes within the democratic
realm. In other words, using and comprehending programming is about agency and
inclusion. With regard to the growing impact of programming not only on economic
productivity but also within the cultural, social and political realm,
this exclusion forms a challenge in terms of equality, inclusion and
chances of participation.

One area in which the challenge of digital literacy and exclusion is
prominent is within humanities research. Academia is increasingly
confronted with large amounts of data. In order to turn this data
into information and into knowledge, researchers and students need
tools that allow them to structure, search, correlate, analyze, but most
importantly, present and visualize this data. 

The same argument also holds for working fields related to the
humanities: museums, libraries and archives are challenged to make the
huge data sets that result from digitization of the cultural heritage
they foster, accessible and understandable for as many people as
possible. Despite the opportunities provided by these mass resources,
generated in numerous digitization projects, humanities researchers and
students are – due to a lack of skills - reluctant to exploit these
troves.

Nonetheless, this project is not reducible to a political or didactic
agenda. Our primary goal is to show that APIs can lead to new forms of
knowledge production. By treating collections primarily as data sets,
we believe that the artworks, cultural artifacts, and policy documents
can be recontextualized in new and exciting ways. Thereby not only
reconfiguring the relation between the collection and the institution in
which it is displayed, but also between the institutions amongst each
other, their relation to the visitors/user, and finally, the user to the
artwork.


### How this research contributes to the humanities, and to ‘digital humanities’ 

This research will serve as a testbed for new forms of collaboration
between public and private partners, bringing the humanities into
non-academic realms. 

The role of the expert (curator or scholar) will be decentralized in
the creation, curation, and exhibition of collections. It will generate
new tools which are specifically aimed at humanities
scholars and will prove useful to them in their research. It will
explore creating new kinds of interfaces in the museum space. This
research will also experiment with new types of (crowd) funding.

This research will discover new forms of exhibitions and citizen
research. New cultural data set and links between existing data sets
and items will be created. Visualisations of many relations between
heterogeneous and distributed data sets will lead to new knowledge
and new questions. Online projects leave a trace of how a new type of
exhibition develops.

Our private partners in this project (Cast Your Art, Weyeser, and Tulip
Interactive) are excellently equiped to push this agenda forward, because ...

### how this research contributes to core technologies identified in White Paper Section 2:

Together with Weyeser we will develop data minig tools to search 
for and discover new patterns and knowledge in governmental and 
heritage collections. 

With Tulip Interactive we will develop new visualization tools for
presenting collections in different ways. 

With Cast Your Art we will develop new modes in which these
collections can be displayed on- and offline.


### How does this research build on relevant state-of-the-art research

Robin Boast's project Assemblage and Diversity: Working with
Incommensurability in Distributed, Emergent Knowledge Networks is also
closely related to this research. It creates a network of objects that
are normally placed in museums and moves them to locations that are
directly relevant to their meaning.

This project is related to several embedded research projects,
"Object-User Relationships (Maldini & Verstraete), Archiving
Interactives (Verstraete & de Vos) and "Users as Muse" (Gimeno-Martinez,
Verstraete & Whittle), which explore the changing relationships between
museums, objects and visitors due to shifts from consumers to users or
prosumers.

Additionally, the VU University project Perspective and Perception,
which explores how graphical projections commonly used in interactive
digital environments influence our perception.

The project Users as Muse (VU), which explores a changing relationship
between museums and their visitors, due to tremendous changes in
audience empowerement, especially in an online environment. Consumers
become prosumers, but museum institutes are still struggling to cope
with the developments in social media and consumer technology. 

The Augmenting Masterpieces project (Barnbeck & Hoogstad) investigates
interactive ways to experience the physical and digital collection of
the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, with the aim to develop a prototype and
map interaction scenarios.

### Why the proposed research team would be best to perform this research

Robin Boast, professor at the University of Amsterdam, has been working
in what we now call the Digital Humanities for over 30 years.

Jan Hein Hoogstad, Assistant Professor at the University of Amsterdam
in Cultural Analysis and Comparative Literature, has extensive coding
experience and a background that connects programming to the humanities.

Katja Kwastek is a professor in Art History at the VU University in
Amsterdam and researches crossroads between art and new media.

Sabrina Sauer is an Assistant Professor at the University of Amsterdam.
Her research combines approaches from Media Studies and Science and
Technology Studies.

Ginette Verstraete, Professor at the VU University, researches the way
mobile (location-based) technologies and their applications (such as
GPS on iPhones) have transformed mobility through urban space.These
sociotechnical transformations raise new substantive issues for the
study of movement in cities, but also for a humanities-based study of
media usage.

### Plans for software and data management and sharing
We will use MIT open source licensing. 


## Budget:

- 1 post-doc position
- 2 PhD positions
- 1 embedded researcher

### Deliverables:

The major deliverable of this research will be the interdisciplenary
coding fair, where students, researchers, developers, and business
people can come together. The fair will demonstrate results of the
research, in the forms of models for new types of collaborative
exhibitions and tools and libraries for data acquisition and
manipulation. This event will be preceded by several smaller pilot
fairs.

Additional deliverables will be digital tools for searching,
discovering, analysing and visualising patterns in online collections.

Publication of several articles and at least one book.

## Project Management

The Principle Investigators will be Robin Boast from the University
of Amsterdam and Ginette Verstraete from the VU University. They will
coordinate the collaboration plan. Periodical meetings will take place

## Valorization

+ the exhibition and events working up to it can be used as a model for other collections and locations. Other organisations and movements can easily start their own local events.
+ existing tools and methods developed in research projects such as CATCH can be reused and the prototypes can be further developed into full-fledged products.
+ creative industries can use the models for exhibiting collections out of context to make their catalogue of online and offline exhibitions which they can monetize by targeting interested audiences.
+ the deliverables of this project will create a new market of organisations and individuals with an interest to use discovery and visualisation tools for their own organisational or local exhibitions and fairs. 
+ because we use MIT licencing, companies can reuse code and tools created in the project to make commercial products. 
+ Weyeser and Tulip Interactive will develop prototype tools for discovering and visualising new collections and new perspectives of collections that they can further develop into products. Through the interactions with users on the platform and contributors to the exhibition, they gain valuable information about the interests and needs of the users of their tools.

### Expected societal and economic impacts

Society will benefit from community involvement in the exhibition
itself. This entirely new kind of exhibition uses coding skills to make
an intervention in areas that are crucial to the past, present, and the
future of the humanities: politics, literacy, culture, and knowledge
production.

### Teaching and training benefits
Developers, students, artists, curators, designers, will all learn from each other in the exhibition's interactive, international and interdisciplenary environment. 

# How this project contributes to the long-term development of CHAT

We will also build on the work of the Virtual Museum Transnational
Network (http://www.v-must.net/) and Material Encounters with Digital
Cultural Heritage (http://mesch-project.eu/). The NWO CATCH and
CATCHplus projects have developed new tools and collections that this
project will make use of and extend upon.
