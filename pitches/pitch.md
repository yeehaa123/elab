In the recent years we have witnessed an increasing demand in coding
experience in various working fields closely related to the humanities.
Knowledge institutions require programs to archive, search, digitize
and present their rich heritage. Media professionals, but also
archaeologists, musicians or historians more and more rely on digital
resources for their work and need basic coding skills to enhance their
workflow and research. But already at university level coding skills
become an important instrument to pursue ambitious research interests.

In order to face these challenges scientific foundations offer an
increasing number of grants that aim to accelerate innovative processes
in the creative industries and knowledge institutions, starting from
small national grants and to large internationally oriented funding
opportunities over extensive time spans. To boost collaborations between
private and public partners is one of the major goals of these programs.

THE CODING LAB is addressing these changing work and research
requirements by providing humanities students with an on- and offline
learning and research environment which allows them to develop and
apply coding skills, so that they are enabled to produce the customized
digital tools that fit their research and work. TCL is not only
increasing the employability of humanities students but also connects
external partners to students who understand to analyze and approach
humanities questions from the perspective of coding.

THE CODING LAB aims to be an incubator for collaborations between public
and private partners that are keen to explore new means of knowledge
production and productively challenge conventional forms of teaching and
scholarship by the creation of innovative information infrastructures
and research environments.

These ambitions are in line with research agenda promoted by
institutions like the European Research Council or the Dutch NWO.

##APPROACH 

We are convinced that current technological changes demand ways of
teaching, collaboration and knowledge production. The digitization
of everything and the internet of things require humanities students
to develop a keen understanding of their new technological, digital
surroundings. This knowledge should be a acquired in an open, accessible
environment that allows students collaboratively learn how to code, to
tinker with programs, figure out and invent.
	
The lab therefore intents to kick-of new forms of on- and offline
collaboration which is ideally founded on an international cooperation
with various partners ranging from SMEs and startups to public partners
like universities cultural institutions.

The approach and the development of the students can be divided into
three stages which do overlap.

/ Yeehaa: Also great! /


#### 1. seminar phase / learn 

+ provide students with basic coding skills in a language that is widely
applicable (JavaScript)

+ make them learn “online first”, so they can form peer-groups in
which they teach and help each other

+ readings that sharpen their analytical skills concerning technological
developments and the relation of man/culture/technology


#### 2. lab phase / apply

+ produce a framework that motivates students to experiment with the
knowledge gained from seminar and attract humanities students that might
not have been at the seminar but have basic coding skills

+ eventually the lab should also attract students with no coding
experience and no advanced technological understanding and allow them to
learn from their peers

+ allow students to follow own projects and form project based groups

+ allow students to present their projects

#### 3. internationalize the project / connect

+ kick-of collaborations between students, public and private partners
by hosting meet-ups, workshops, hackathons and conferences

+ with the network established reach out to new public and private
partners via the established online environment with other public
parters

+ e.g. connect to the maker movement


### STATUS QUO

The first group of students follows the Coding the Humanities seminar
an successfully accomplish given tasks by helping each other online.

Embedded research with the Rijks Museum Datadrive Coding Sessiosn


### PRIVATE PARTNERS

+ participate in a testbed for innovative collaboration and knowledge production

+ recruit talents that are trained in cutting edge development tools and
best practices

+ gain access to an international network of other public and private
partners which might lead to further projects and collaborations

+ get involved in a project that meets the innovation agenda HORIZON
2020 of the European Research Council and which therefore is seeking to
acquire corresponding grants and funding


### PUBLIC PARTNERS 

+ internationalize their according projects 

+ thereby increase their chance to attract long term funding opportunities

+ can benefit form the established online learning environment and
establish “online first” projects at their institutes


### COMPETITORS ADVANTAGE 

THE CODING LAB is, unlike other digital humanities programs, seeking to
give humanities students the ability to code, and does not form pools
of IT experts who program and design tools for the humanities. This
approach from within does justice to the specific demand in cultural
institutions as well as the creative industries at large for a combined
expertise in humanities research and coding skills.

TCL's online first and peer-learning approach allows the students to
develop a sense of technological developments and take on agency. These
students do not rely on prefabricated tools for their research and work.
Ideally they create them themselves. This path will result in a variety
of new applications that supports not only humanities centered research
but also allows third parties to support and accelerate their processes.

The open and creative approach offers external partners multiple ways to
bring in their expertise, co-design the coming into of the lab and test
new ideas
