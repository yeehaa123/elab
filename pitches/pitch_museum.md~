Coding the Humanities

With the digitization of cultural objects cultural institutions face new challenges and opportunities 
concerning the archiving, query, analysis, visualization, presentation, interaction 
with their collections.

The new technologies demand a perspective that exceeds IT expertise but asks for a combination of 
programming skills and a solid humanities education.  

Coding the Humanities is addressing this need by providing humanities students with an online 
learning and research environment in order to develop and apply coding skills. These skills 
enable them to produce customized digital tools that fit their research and work. 

Coding the Humanities aims to be an incubator for collaborations between public
 and private partners that are keen to explore new research perspectives, new ways of 
letting visitors engage with and experience cultural objects and new forms of knowledge production. 

//Scientific foundations offer an increasing number of grants that aim to accelerate innovative 
processes in the creative industries and knowledge institutions. Our ambitions are thus in line 
with research agenda promoted by institutions like the European Research Council or the Dutch NWO.//
