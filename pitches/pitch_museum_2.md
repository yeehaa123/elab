#Coding the Humanities

Coding the Humanities provides a programming course aimed specifically at humanities students, that combines practical 
assignments, theoretical discussions and critical reflection, where students develop their coding and research skills 
collaboratively.

The students develop a unique skillset that allows them to understand the various technologically mediated objects that 
they are studying and prepares them to handle and customize increasingly needed digital tools and technologies for 
archiving, semantic search, data analysis, visualization and presentation from a humanities perspective.

The emphasis on programming offers opportunities for new kinds of large scare collaborative research projects that no 
longer need to be divided into several topics or objects, but can distributed through different tasks and skill sets, 
using tools developed by humanities scholars for humanities scholarship.

The resulting set of customized tools can improve the actual practice of humanities research as well as (the quantity and 
quality of) its output.
