##OverLab - Prototyping a physically flexible, interdisciplinary research environment

Together with the Berlin based, award winning innovation consultancy Dark Horse, we seek to answer the questions of how the ideal workspace for interdisciplinary shortterm researchers such as embedded researchers could look like. How could the working environment be adapted to meet the changed research requirements of knowledge workers at the Center for Digital Humanities, the Creative Industries Research Center Amsterdam and the humanities departments in general?

The development towards more interdisciplinary research settings in the humanities, which span not only from one faculty research group to another or between universities but more and more towards involving private partners from the creative industries, changes the requirements of how researchers operate.
There is an increasing need of knowledge workers to combine theoretical as well as hands-on approaches in their research, but current workspaces do not provide enough space and material to experiment with in order to be innovative.

####OverLab - **a place for overlapping**

- of theory and artistic practice  
- of physical and digital research  
- of studio, workshop, library  
- of institutions - private and public  
- of scholé and ascholía  
- to create an independent place outside the department structure of the university  
- a room that enables, allows to experiment
