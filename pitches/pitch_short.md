**Coding the Humanities** is teaching humanities students how to teach themselves to code. 

**Coding the Humanities** empowers humanities students to shape the technical instruments they rely on, which – depending 
on their very expertise – can slow down or accelerate their work and research.

**Coding the Humanities** thus provides students with agency in order to analyze and react upon the technological condition
that now is predominant especially in their professional and academic lives.

**Coding the Humanities** is not yet another Digital Humanities program since it, rather than to foster the collaboration 
between humanities departments and IT experts, seeks to tear down the wall between experts and layman. It applies an online 
first peer learning environment that inspires students and others to share and collaborate, to discover and invent and most 
importantly to lose fear of tinkering with technical objects.

**Coding the Humanities** is looking for cooperations with external partners who are excited to accompany, foster and shape 
the process of creating an open and  collaborative research and learning environment.
