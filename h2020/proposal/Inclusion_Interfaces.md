#####Approach 

This research proposal consists of three integrated research areas in which public-private-civic partnerships (quad-helix) lead to a sharing of expertise and collaborative practices geared at the development of a cutting-edge innovative educational ecosystem that is specific to the (digital) humanities. These research areas are socio-technical in their approach; apart from combining insights from different partners to develop technological solutions (such as an online educational platform), valorize existing and new R&D methodologies (such as design thinking methodologies and embedded research practices) and the translation of data streams and information in intuitive interfaces that make use of visualization and aim to lower the threshold to engage with ICT and make data sets comprehensible and accessible to a large group. This research proposal therefore seeks to specially gear technological developments and efforts to enhance society by closing the digital divide. By collaborating throughout the project with public, private and civic partners, the project foresees the accumulation of knowledge and a digital skilling of particular hitherto unreached civic groups. 

These efforts should be viewed in line with two overarching developments in contemporary society and in humanities’ research; the move to create smart cities where citizens are digitally empowered and the development of digital humanities. By integrating the digital skilling of citizens with the agenda of the development of digital humanities, the project aims to perform academic research through a digital inclusion methodology/practice. Practically, the envisioned educational platform realizes local engagement, user-focused learning with both an individually-oriented as well as collective component; collaboration and the accumulation of knowledge and skills are key to a successful implementation of the platform. 

Each of the three research areas anticipates and addresses an upcoming challenge. 

#####1. Literary / platform for learning an researcher 

The authority of educational institutions like schools and universities is increasingly challenged by alternative models of knowledge transfer that grant access to large numbers of students. One of the most wide spread format is Massive Open Online Courses. While MOOCs allow a large number of people to follow courses online, the format mimics the classroom situation and cements classical roles of teacher/expert and student/laymen.
 
The Coding the Humanities platform embraces an online first approach that provides students with an online environment does not copy offline education strategies but does justice to the possibilities ICT provides by taking inspiration from collaborative modes widely applied in the field of open source software development. The platforms open format invites everyone to learn and contribute.  

- Users make a profile on GitHub, an online public platform for maintaining and sharing repositories that has distributed version control (each user has access to all versions of all documents in the project and can modify existing projects). Their profiles contain all their work, every single contribution to their repositories, which encourages sharing and reuse but also provides them with a portfolio which shows their skills. This portfolio increases the employability of humanities students. 

- The platform is developed in JavaScript, which will also be the main programming language that is used on the platform. JavaScript is the language that is used on most websites and in all modern web browsers to let the user interact with the web. The advantage of using JavaScript is that it gives users access to the full stack of technologies: client-side, server-side and database levels can be controlled with JavaScript. With it, programmers can interact with data on any website and any web platform. JavaScript also combines the major programming paradigms, so users switching to other programming languages will recognise many elements and don't need to start from scratch. 

- Developments in programming languages have shifted the focus from computation to language. Commands in modern programming languages are more like natural language expressions, whereas older languages forced programmers to formulate very algebraic commands. This makes modern languages more intuitive to use, which lowers the threshold and together with the vast number of interesting JavaScript modules available on the web, even novice programmers can build interesting applications in a matter of hours or days instead of months or years. Promoting programming skills to a large audience makes more sense now than ever before. 

- All interaction with the platform is done via the web browser. All modern browsers allow users to directly interact with web sites and servers through the browser console using JavaScript. Thereby users can directly apply their coding skills to anything they encounter on the web. Another advantage is that this minimises the threshold to developing and using programmings skills, as web browsers are found on most computers and are provided by default with all popular operating systems. At the same time, using JavaScript in the browser exposes users to the full range of programming possibilities. 

- The platform is tool oriented. Students develop small tools and widgets that perform small parts of the research they want to conduct. The reason to focus on tools is that researchers in general and humanities scholars in particular need to reflect critically on the tools they use for their research. By becoming proficient at conceptualizing and developing tools, scholars develop a keen eye for perceiving how digital tools work in general. 


#####2. Organization / collaboration over ownership 

The importance of user-centricity is a central topic across (scientific) disciplines such as product design, business and marketing studies. The recent avowal that users drive innovation in the time of wikinomics, crowdsourcing and social networking seems to have sparked this interest further, leading to both utopian and dystopian views about what consumers can contribute to innovation practices. At times, access to ICTs is equated with increased democracy, as well as with both social and business innovation. Democratizing design practices would offer technology users even more power to make “a difference” while at the same time providing a way for technology producers to make a product more successful on the market. After all, doesn’t involving the expected future users in the design process of a new ICT product stimulate the creation of a market for said product? At the same time, critical questions are asked about the “revolution” offered by online (web 2.0) technologies. Scholars question the extent to which “the digital revolution” should be equated with a social revolution and call for critical awareness of the socioeconomic implications of trends such as “co-creation” (Van Dijck & Nieborg, 2009); what interests are at play in these practices and how can these be deconstructed?

One approach to realize co-creation practices, specifically between public-private-civic partners, is the so-called Living Lab-approach. Living Labs situate ICT development practices in daily life settings to gain insights about unexpected uses of technologies. ICT users, in turn, are not only primarily included in their role of “user”, but also in guises mostly associated with those involved in the design and development process of ICTs. Coupled, the unexpected knowledge ascertained by changing the site of and the people “in” the laboratory is ultimately to lead to the development of more successful innovative ICT products and services. By transforming mundane environments into experimentation areas, interactions – in this case between users and technologies-in-the-making in this environment - become the subject of enquiry for Living Laboratories. “The unexpected” is expected to be found by investigating user-technology interactions. Living Labs can thus be said to adhere to a promise that is not unlike a tagline of a generic blockbuster film, namely to “expect the unexpected”.

But how is the uncovering of the unexpected achieved such co-creative (e)laboratories? Previous insights in the discovery of knowledge in scientific laboratories show how in these controlled environments messy relationships and processes become stabilised and “purified” into “a textual account of nature, and a set of more of less formulaic statements about method” (Law, 2007: 4). Facts are shown to be constructed; Science and Technology Studies scholars such as Latour and Woolgar (1979) trace how sociomaterial interactions in the laboratory become stabilised in accepted facts. Attempting to find unexpected insights in environments that are expressly less controlled and situated in “the living”, suggests that these labs actively seek out open and messy sociomaterial practices in order to find a kind of knowledge “in the wild” (Hutchins, 1995).

While the research area of Living Labs and public-private-civic partnerships is still in its early development, research into open innovation practices in labs that are formed out of public-private-civic partnerships show certain trends pertaining to the inclusion of end users in open innovation practices. For example while these labs may seek to democratize design and development of new ICT products and services, the end user as such is more often than not mainly included as part of the user-centric methodology, not as part of the partnership consortium. This has implications; whereas the promise of democratization and of uncovering unexpected and innovative ideas and practices of end users, locking “the user” into their role of “user” seems to preclude precisely the treatment of this user as an “equal”, providing input during development directly. Users are characterized, for example, as in need of motivation to join in on laboratory activities.

Innovation practices are not easily dividable in clear-cut categories of top down or bottom-up innovation. For example, Daft (1978) observes both processes of top down and bottom-up innovation in organizational innovation. In the same vein, Enkel and colleagues (Enkel, Gassmann, & Chesbrough, 2009) articulate the importance of different flows of knowledge to help establish (open) innovation: outside-in processes, inside-out processes and coupled processes, the latter of which is specifically connected to practices of co-creation. Chesbrough argues that in order to cope with the uncertain success of innovations, companies should open up their innovation processes. Likening the hitherto “traditional” innovation processes of firms to a game of chess, he proposes that in practicing open innovation, companies should instead focus on developing a process for playing poker. This means accepting that successful innovation is very much uncertain and dependent on uncontrollable contextual (in this case market) conditions (Chesbrough, 2004: 25). Be it chess or poker, games start with people who are willing to play. In Living Laboratories, prospective technology users are invited to join the game of open innovation. At the same time, these users are part of the gameplay itself; their inclusion is part of the rulebook. Their actions, ideas and contributions may well be, coupled with the fact that Living Lab-practices are set in a daily life setting, “the uncertain” elements that characterise open innovation in Living Labs. Still, their inclusion is regarded with some ambivalence exactly because of the uncertain outcomes. It is not clear in advance what their contributions will bring to the innovation process.

Increasingly funding is spread competitively for small research periods, also in order to foster the collaboration between the public and the private sector, for example in the form of embedded researchers. These researchers facilitate links between universities and public or private partners. They act as ambassadors between academia and the private sector, for example between humanities departments and the creative industries. 

However, even though the emphasis here is on sustainable research, the projects are often closed and presented and not open for further development (unless some additional funding allows to proceed).
Truely sustainable research is open and would mean that a project has releases - at some point (after the official end of the research period) other students, embedded researchers are allowed and encouraged to take the outcome of the research, alter and develop it further.

Here the strategies of the online platform can be translated into an offline space. This open physical lab thus explores how online, ICT based collaboration can be transferred into the offline world and enhance offline collaboration. At the same time this lab explores how ICT based projects can be enhance and made more sustainable by offline events and collaboration. 

Though the future of research lies more and more in collaborations between disciplines and fields, between public and private partnerships, practice and theory, between classic methodology and flexible theory, co-creation and collaborations the interdisciplinary researcher enters work spaces which are not built by or for them and uses methodology and means of exposure which remain in the respective fields. 

Where artists use their atelier, designers their studio and scientists their lab for experimentation, testing and collaboration, the embedded researcher enters a traditional, disciplinary university environment even though they are often expected to address research questions with a practical and creative research aspect. But artistic expression and creativity do not obey closing hours and bureaucratic sterility of university buildings.

A virtual and physical lab is essential to compensate for the abovementioned problems. An online and offline platform - that already exists before they start, and will start after their contracts end - a space is a necessary precondition for Embedded Research projects that are actually sustainable. In this project we want to explore how such a lab should look like.

Therefore this project seeks to investigate and built upon the combined needs for newly established forms of research by means of self-reflective research by the combined skills and expertise of the public and private partner using design thinking. 
When working from a human-centered approach it is crucial to not think of the form of the outcome right away or to be limited to just one medium or technology. But in order to experiment and innovate, a flexible workspace is as much needed as a flexible methodological framework which stimulates creating research designs with specific tools. 

The work space of the embedded researchers are regular office spaces at the university, supplied with a desk and a computer. The scope of most projects however require a variety of work settings.
When working from a human-centered approach it is crucial to not think of the form of the outcome right away or to be limited to just one medium or technology. But in order to experiment and innovate, a flexible workspace is needed. Artistic expression and creativity do not obey closing hours and bureaucratic sterility of university buildings.

How could the ideal workspace for knowledge workers within the faculty of the humanities at the UvA look like? How could the working environment be adapted to meet the changed research requirements of knowledge workers at the Departments for Digital Humanities, Media Studies, Cultural Analysis and Artistic Research?
How can these physical structures create a sustainable link with an online learning environment? And how can the analogue and digital workspaces best be linked to each other?

#####3. Interfaces / Inclusion 

Academia is increasingly confronted with large amounts of data. In order to turn this data into information and into knowledge, researchers and students need tools that allow to structure, search, correlate, analyze but most importantly present and visualize this data. This is also true for working fields related to the humanities: museums, libraries and archives are challenged to make the huge data sets that result from digitalization of the cultural heritage they foster //opencultuur.nl//, accessible and understandable for as many people as possible. Despite the opportunities these  mass resources generated in numerous digitization projects provide, humanities researchers and students are reluctant to exploit these troves. 

//"While digital resources are becoming more visible in the humanities, use of these resources by scholars remains limited. … Digitization projects are bringing texts, data sources, sound, and images to the scholar’s desktop; however, the functions on which research in the humanities depend are neither well understood nor well supported by librarians."// (Brockman et al, 2001) / Bradley Text 

Also municipalities and governments increasingly share their data openly online. The skills to compile graspable information out of big data sets becomes more important on the level of politics and social agency. It allows civic movements but also single citizens to understand political and social processes, identify problems and develop solutions – that can be software based. //gelt project // white house data // open knowledge foundation//. 

Visualizations like cartography, timelines, graphs, diagrams or animations, but also the design of interactive interfaces, thus help to translate data into knowledge by providing a context for different information and a combination of different data sets. This approach can boost humanities research and at the same time it makes humanities concepts and research productive and understandable for a broader audience as the visual translation of the data can inspire the mind to new insights. 

Coding the Humanities trains students to read and handle data streams and shows possible ways to translate these into visualizations. The programming language the students are encouraged to learn first, JavaScript, holds a low threshold for the practical application of code in various fields, visualization being one of them. 

The students apply the knowledge gained early on by exploring existing JavaScript libraries such as Data Driven Documents [http://d3js.org/](http://d3js.org/). This open source code collection allows the students to understand the translation of data into visualization but also empowers them to pursue little projects from which they can gain new perspectives on the data relevant to their research. These tools enhance the analysis and understanding of complex relations and concepts relevant to humanities research. At the same time data sets become comprehensible and presentable to a broader audience. 

The developed tools can be applied to different data sets. Especially with regard to the above mentioned open data sets provided by more and more cultural institutions and organizations, data visualization tools provide a great foundation for collaborative activities between universities and other institutions. These tools allow to exceed the mode of mere data processing to the actual production of new insights and knowledge. 

In this research field we will therefore combines private partners with expertise in the field of visualization and interfaces but also in the production of videos and audios. These private partners will be complemented by museums which, with datasets related to their collections, can provide a real setting in which the knowledge can be applied. 

**Consortium** 

In this research field we work with the Dutch company weyeser with its expertise in supporting organizations to translate big amounts of data into knowledge by means of data mining, text mining and visualization. So far their solutions offer governments, governmental institutions, universities, think tanks and corporations ways of objectively assessing their knowledge portfolio and that of their peers. Within the framework of CtH weyeser will support humanities students in the analysis and visualization of the humanities related data sets relevant to their research. 

Weyesers expertise with visialisations and interfaces is accompanied by Austrian company CastYourArt which is focused on consulting, production and online/offline distribution of audio and video material in which they present artists, exhibitions and collectors and take art out of the museum context. 

The public partners inviolved are the Royal Tropical Institute, a research institut with five Dutch museums attached  and Europeana, the network of european libraries, archives and other cultural institutions. 


//We would love to initiate a collaboration between you and the private/public partners that allows Coding the Humanities researchers and students to explore new formats to make data and information related to museum collections accessible and experienceable. With regard to the private partners these explorations could involve the conception and development of visualizations in general terms, as video or audio and/or in form of interfaces.// 

//In a series of workshops the students/researchers should learn about the status quo of visualization within the museums context. Their humanities background then allows them to comprehend how to turn data into a narrative and thus develop perspectives on how address visitors in new ways. With their coding skills and the support of the private partner, the students will collectively conceptualize and develop software solutions for field but not limited to this field.// 

//Europeana would provide us with API access, advice and critique from an institutionalised repository, and participate in joint meetings and publications. In terms of budget we should make sure they get a travel budget (€2,000 per year?), and some time (for participation and contributions). We will need to check with Jill to see if that is ok and how much they need for time, but I would guess that about €10-15K per year would be more than enough.// 


Moreover, the consortium in this research field will be completed by a public partner, the Tropenmuseum Amsterdam, which will initiate projects that encourage students to work with the datasets related to their collection. In a series of workshops with the private and the public partner the students will learn about the status quo of visualization within the museums context. With their humanities background the students are predestined to comprehend how to turn data into a narrative and how to meet the demands of the visitor. With their coding skills and the support of the private partner, the students will collective conceptualize and develop software solutions for this field but not limited to this field. The outcome of this project will be accessible and free to use by other students, scholars, cultural institutions or civic movements.  

Visualization empowers the students to make the increasing number of large datasets productive for their research. The new perspectives gained also provide arguments and strategies for a larger audience ranging from museums to foundations to civic movements. 

#####digital elites / Inclusion 

As Chinn and Fairly have shown in their cross country analysis on digital divide (Chinn and Fairly, 2004) there are not only dramatic geographic differences in accessibility to and user skills of ICT but also socio-economic and demographic gaps. There is a large group of children, women, elderly and economically disadvantaged that are or face to be digitally excluded. 

With regard to the growing impact of ICT not only on economic productivity but also in all other fields, such as the cultural, social and political realm, this exclusion forms a serious thread to societies in terms of equality, inclusion and chances of participation. 

ICT is no longer restricted to tools that enhance communication. With continually increasing funding for the ambition to create smart cities and through integration of ICT into ever more objects of everyday life like watches, clothes, fridges - a situation coined with the term "internet of things" - accessibility and digital literacy determine whether a person is included into social and cultural life, is employable and, perhaps more importantly, whether they can participate in decision making processes within the democratic realm. In other words, using and comprehending ICT tools is about agency and inclusion. 

Yet, next to the aspect of accessibility the digital divide is fundamentally about the right use and understanding of ICT. 

As evaluations of the project one laptop per child have shown (Christia et al, 2012), access to ICT does not guarantee an automatic improvement of skills, e.g. in the classical educational subjects like math or reading. Access needs to be accompanied by training and education that allows children and other potentially excluded groups to understand the utility and power of the digital tools they hold in their hands. This training needs to address the intrinsic curiosity that makes kids wonder how things work. 


Instead of providing kids and other non tech savy groups with digital tools running programs presumably suiting their needs, these groups need to be sensitized to wonder what a program is and how it can be altered, how a specific tool can be modified and adjusted to their specific needs and desires (which might not overlap with those of the tech elite). 

This research field will therefore explore the crucial question on how the motivation of a diverse group of people that do not have an affinity for ICT can be addressed, so they understand the challenges and opportunities that ICT holds for their lives and provide them with an sustainable way to acquire an understanding of the technologies that goes beyond a mere knowledge of how to use the gadgets at hand. 

It seeks to deliver an answer to the question of how we can enable people of all ages and with various socio-economical backgrounds (CURRENT SITUATIONS?) to overcome the reluctance OR OBSTACLES? towards their technological surrounding and lower the threshold to engage and develop a sustainable interests in these gadgets. These interests should be driven by a practical motivation strong enough to encourage them to pass on the knowledge gained to others and pursue group based interest driven projects in which this knowledge is applied. 
ON SCOPE: I THINK THE FOCUS IS ON THOSE WHO DO HAVE THE OPTION TO ENGAGE WITH ICT BUT FEEL RELUCTANT TO DO SO. I KNOW THE PLATFORM WILL BE OPEN TO EVERYONE ALL OVER THE WORLD, BUT WHO SPECIFICALLY DO WE REALISICALLY EXPECT TO PARTICIPATE? 

In this field the level of technical knowledge non tech savy people already have and the possibilities to motivate an engagement with ICT that goes beyond a mere user knowledge will be researched. Based on the tools provided on the learning platform and combined with information events and workshops at the lab space the possible application of coding knowledge to practical fields related to the everyday life of people will trigger their motivation to learn and teach each others in order to solve a concrete problem. In that sense an awareness of the powerful practical impact of coding skills and a better understanding of ICT (economically, socially, culturally, for education and knowledge production) have to be communicated. 

In order to make this tool oriented problem solving approach sustainable, it needs to foster and organize a community that is not only provided with an online peer learning environment but has to be accelerated by offline events at which problems to be solved can be negotiated, projects be started and most importantly, people can engage with technology as layman with the fear to fail. 

The outcome will be a set of very practical tools, that address the needs of a wide audience and thus might also advance the interest of a wide audience in tech. 

By avoiding the high theoretical threshold typical to academic ICT programs and focusing on the developments of tools that solve small everyday problems. 

ICT has to be related to the interest of students / people – they have to understand how the increasing dominance of ICT in all fields affects them and how they can make these tools productive form their interests. 

Conservative computer science or programming programs start on such a high and abstract level, that does not allow people to relate it to their research interest or everyday life. 

- how coding enables them to understand their surroundings and can provide them with agency  

Humanities studies already seek to explore how tools affect us and change things. This project aims to extend that curiosity to digital tools. The coding platform communicates to humanities students in their language / approaches new technology from a humanities perspective, making it accessible to them to become open to coding. 

<!--- Marijn: the problem is well explained. Now how are we going to tackle this? A humanities interest in tools, i.e., how they affect us and change things, could be an interesting perspective to address motivation. The interest from a Mediastudies perspective probably speaks more to laymen than the interest from a computer science perspective. So a platform that explains tools from a media perspective but through code could be a better trigger than the boring and abstract computer science MOOCs on offer today. ---> 



*Describe any national or international research and innovation activities which will be linked with the project, especially where the outputs from these will feed into the project;* 

//CIRCA// //ADH// //http://www.lifeparticipation.org// Action 60: Increase participation of women in the ICT workforce 
[https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/pillar-vi-enhancing-digital-literacy-skills-and-inclusion/action-60-increase-participation-women-ict](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/pillar-vi-enhancing-digital-literacy-skills-and-inclusion/action-60-increase-participation-women-ict) 


*Describe and explain the overall approach, distinguishing, as appropriate, coordination and support activities;* 
* The overall approach to this project is to stimulate both self-empowerment and at the same time, collaboration, between those working in the humanities those outside academia. This will be done by offering PhD positions, encouraging embedded research activities, and working together with Human Design companies for fruitful interaction in the physical lab. There is already an extensive amount of coordination between the University of Amsterdam and outside institutions for this project. Productive meetings with several companies have taken place, including Dark Horse.  

*Where relevant, describe how sex and/or gender analysis is taken into account in the project’s content.* 
- Empowering people to use technology, including those who are hesitant or face obstacles to do so, means that we have a specific focus on girls and women, as they often face greater obstacles to accessing technology and education in general. Raising awareness of this issue, fostering discussion on feminism and coding, and working to create new ways of increasing the participation of girls and women in coding are all essential elements to our project. 

- The number of woman attracted by coding within CtH could be increased by collaborations with initiatives that seek to do the same - increase the number of female coders, like Railsgirls [http://railsgirls.com/](http://railsgirls.com/) or geekettes [http://www.geekettes.io/](http://www.geekettes.io/) in forms of workshops, information evenings in the lab. 

A recent EU study shows that only 30% of the people in the ICT sector in Europe are woman, a number that mirrors the low number of woman with a degree in that field. [Digital Agenda: Bringing more women into EU digital sector would bring €9 billion annual GDP boost, EU study shows](http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-13-905_en.htm) While the same study shows the potential of having more woman working in that field traditional ICT programs fail to attract female students. At the same time female students in the humanities outnumber male students. Thus an approach like CtH holds enormous potential to engage more women in ICT via their research interests. The seminar *Coding the Humanities* at the university of amsterdam has shown that, in combination with tools relevant to their research, woman are as keen as men to engage with coding. 

*Sex and gender refer to biological characteristics and social/cultural factors respectively. For guidance on methods of sex / gender analysis and the issues to be taken into account, please refer to [http://ec.europa.eu/research/science-society/gendered-innovations/index_en.cfm](http://ec.europa.eu/research/science-society/gendered-innovations/index_en.cfm)* 


###2. Impact 

####2.1 Expected impacts 

*Please be specific, and provide only information that applies to the proposal and its objectives. Wherever possible, use quantified indicators and targets.* 

*Describe how your project will contribute to the expected impacts set out in the work programme, under the relevant topic;* 

This project will directly contribute to the expected impacts set out in the work programme. 

*Describe any barriers/obstacles, and any framework conditions (such as regulation and standards), that may determine whether and to what extent the expected impacts will be achieved. (This should not include any risk factors concerning implementation, as covered in section 3.2.)* 


####2.2 Measures to maximise impact 

**a) Dissemination and exploitation of results** 

*Provide a draft ‘plan for disseminating and exploiting the project’s results’ (unless the work programme topic explicitly states that such a plan is not required). The plan, which should be proportionate to the scale of the project, should contain measures to be implemented both during and after the project;*  

//The result will be an increased learning from experience, a boosted transferability of results and, as a consequence, an increased lasting effect of the supported activities// 
//Horizon 2020 plays a central role in the delivery of the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth and acts as a vehicle for leveraging private investment, creating new job opportunities// 
//The result will be an increased learning from experience, a boosted transferability of results and, as a consequence, an increased lasting effect of the supported activities.// 

*Dissemination and exploitation measures should address the full range of potential users and uses including research, commercial, investment, social, environmental, policy making, setting standards, skills and educational training.* 

*The approach to innovation should be as comprehensive as possible, and must be tailored to the specific technical, market and organisational issues to be addressed.* 
 
*Explain how the proposed measures will help to achieve the expected impact of the project. Include a business plan where relevant;* 

*Where relevant, include information on how the participants will manage the research data generated and/or collected during the project, in particular addressing the following issues:* 

*What types of data will the project generate/collect?* 

*What standards will be used?* 

*How will this data be exploited and/or shared/made accessible for verification and re-use? If data cannot be made available, explain why.* 

*How will this data be curated and preserved?*  

*You will need an appropriate consortium agreement to manage (amongst other things) the ownership and access to key knowledge (IPR, data etc.). These will allow you, collectively and individually, to pursue market opportunities arising from the project's results.*  

*Outline the strategy for knowledge management and protection. Include measures to provide open access (free on-line access such as the ‘green’ or ‘gold’ model) to peer-reviewed scientific publications which might result from the project.* 

*Open access publishing (also called 'gold' open access) means that an article is immediately provided in open access mode by the scientific publisher. The associated costs are usually shifted away from readers, and instead (for example) to the university or research institute to which the researcher is affiliated, or to the funding agency supporting the research.* 

*Self-archiving (also called 'green' open access) means that the published article or the final peer-reviewed manuscript is archived by the researcher - or a representative - in an online repository before, after or alongside its publication. Access to this article is often - but not necessarily - delayed (‘embargo period’) as some scientific publishers may wish to recoup their investment by selling subscriptions and charging pay-per-download/view fees during an exclusivity period.* 


**b) Communication activities** 

Describe the proposed communication measures for promoting the project and its findings during the period of the grant. Measures should be proportionate to the scale of the project, with clear objectives.  They should be tailored to the needs of various audiences, including groups beyond the project’s own community. Where relevant, include measures for public/societal engagement on issues related to the project. 


###3. Implementation 

####3.1	Work plan – Work packages, deliverables and milestones 

*Please provide the following:* 

*brief presentation of the overall structure of the work plan* 

The proposed project is structured into four research fields: 
 
1) an online platform for learning and research, that allows students to aqcuire coding skills and work collaboratively 
2) a space for embedded research – an offline space that complements the online platform and provides an in-between environment for university and public and private partners 
3) the exploration of the opportunities interfaces and visualization of data holds for knowledge production 
4) research that aims at developing strategies for development and inclusion 

These fields are going to be explored by phd students, embedded researchers and students in combination with public and private partners. Inspired by open source culture and software development practices the fields are going to be explored simultaneously so that insights from one of the fields can be applied transferred early on to the other fields.
