##OverLab – From Living Lab to eLab.

###Prototyping a physically flexible, interdisciplinary research environment 

####		OverLab - a place for overlapping

- of theory and artistic practice
- of physical and digital research
- of studio, workshop, library
- of institutions - private and public
- of scholé and ascholía
- to create an independent place outside the department structure of the university
- a room that enables, allows to experiment

> Thus, when we think of the factory of the future we should rather think of it as scientific laboratoria, art academies and libraries and discotheques instead of our contemporary factories. And the apparatushuman (Apparatmenschen) of the future we have to imagine as an academic rather than a craftsmen, worker or engineer. *Flusser 2002b: 170*

>However, because these entities represent exceptions to the principle of organizing our research programs within regular academic channels, they may create unique challenges that must be addressed in order for them to succeed.

Summary of the project

The future of research lies more and more in collaborations between disciplines and fields, between public and private partnerships, practice and theory, between classic methodology and flexible theory, co-creation and collaborations. 
However, the interdisciplinary researcher enters work spaces which are not built by or for them. Where artists use their atelier, designers their studio and scientists their lab for experimentation, testing and collaboration, the embedded researcher enters a traditional, disciplinary university environment.

Therefore this project seeks to investigate and built upon the combined needs for newly established forms of researchs by means of self-reflective research by the combined skills and expertise of the public and private partner. 
The embedded researcher's profile is a short-term research project which seeks to establish sustainable collaborations between the creative industries and universities.

The interdisciplinary research setting of an embedded researcher in the humanities span not only from one faculty research group to another or between universities but more and more towards involving private partners from the creative industries, thus changes the requirements of how researchers operate.

The work space of the embedded researchers are regular office spaces at the university, supplied with a desk and a computer. The scope of most projects however require a variety of work settings.
When working from a human-centered approach it is crucial to not think of the form of the outcome right away or to be limited to just one medium or technology. But in order to experiment and innovate, a flexible workspace is needed. Artistic expression and creativity do not obey closing hours and bureaucratic sterility of university buildings.

The first result will be a prototype for a research environment for interdisciplinary short term projects. As a test case functions the embedded research track and their participants at the Center for Digitial Humanities and Creative Industries Research Center at the University of Amsterdam, who describe the challenging, but enabling situation and the potentials of the room for experimentation in order to transfer this knowledge onto other interdisciplinary reserach projects. 

Need

- increasing need of knowledge workers to combine theoretical as well as hands-on approaches in their research
- current workspaces do not provide enough space and the right material to experiment


Challenge

The work space of the embedded researchers are regular office spaces at the university, supplied with a desk and a computer. The scope of most projects however require a variety of work settings.
When working from a human-centered approach it is crucial to not think of the form of the outcome right away or to be limited to just one medium or technology. But in order to experiment and innovate, a flexible workspace is needed. Artistic expression and creativity do not obey closing hours and bureaucratic sterility of university buildings.

//Yeehaa: Embedded researcher is a new and exiting role within the university. Its goal is to establish sustainable partnerships between private partners and universities. In practice, however, this turns out to be problematic, since the role and position of this kind of researcher is peripheral by definition. The embedded research usual works on short term projects and inbetween the academy and a company.

We believe that a virtual and physical lab is essential to compensate for the abovementioned problems. An online and offline platform - that already exists before they start, and will start after their contracts end - a space is a necessary precondition for ER project that are actually sustainable. In this project we want to explore how such a lab should look like.//

How could the ideal workspace for knowledge workers within the faculty of the humanities at the UvA look like? How could the working environment be adapted to meet the changed research requirements of knowledge workers at the Departments for Digital Humanities, Media Studies, Cultural Analysis and Artistic Research?


#### How to: user-centered approach Design Thinking 

//Johanna: I asked DH to include their visuals of the Design Thinking process, waiting for them to send it. [Here is a preview](http://www.thedarkhorse.de/images/01_prozess.png) //

- aims at ﬁnding out about users’s needs via an ethnographic research tools
- synthesizes, narrows insights down to hit the core of a problem
- condensed synthesis enables to start into an ideation part
- generates a broad variety of ideas
- makes ideas tangible in rapid and rough prototypes, cost-efﬁcient development


Future University related research has to be informed by open methodologies. Increasingly funding is spread competitively for small research periods, also in order to foster the collaboration between the public and the private sector, for example in the form of embedded researchers. Even though the emphasis here is on sustainable research, the projects are often closed and presented and not open for further development (unless some additional funding allows to proceed) 
Truely sustainable research is OPEN and would mean that a project has releases - at some point (after the official end of the research period) other students, embedded researchers are allowed and encouraged to take the outcome of the research, alter and develop it further. At some point (after the official end of the research period) other students, embedded researchers are allowed and encouraged to take the outcome of the research, alter and develop it further.

Dark Horse is an innovation agency based in Berlin which creates user-centered products and services and helps clients to change their structures, processes and minds. Their work is based on Design Thinking principles and their own unusual working culture that simultaneously stresses ﬂexibility and connections. They design spatial, procedural and social conditions of collaboration in on and offline settings. Guided by their participative design approach, they created spaces and working culture for collaboration in science and creative industry.

Within the proposed project Dark Horse is going to conduct research on and develop of a conceptual framework and design of a physical space that accompanies and complements the online learning platform. Their user centered approach and the background in anthropology and interior design allows Lisa Zoth and Patrick Kenzler to understand and translate the requirements of such a space into a practical design concept and the according user culture. They will provide an answer to the crucial question of how online collaboration and innovative practice can be initiated, accelerated and fostered through an offline setting. Moreover their research will give insights to the students needs that cannot be satisfied merely by the application of ICT but are better addressed with a combination of digital instruments and offline collaboration and training methods.

Research questions that are being adressed / critical questions to be answered in the proposal:

- How can embedded research projects most effectively be realized when conducted and managed outside of existing organizational units? 
- What is the likelihood of long-term and active participation in the OverLab structure by faculty and (graduate) students? 
- What impact (positive or negative) will the OverLab have on the participating faculties' home academic department? 
- What resources will be required to support the unit, and how will those resources be obtained and managed? 
- To what extent will establishment of the new entity help to attract external support? 

*Questions adjusted from “Rationale and Impact” for Establishing and Managing Independent Laboratories, Institutes and Centers at the Stanford University.*
