Summary

The future of research lies more and more in collaborations between disciplines and fields, between public and private partnerships, practice and theory, between classic methodology and flexible theory, co-creation and collaborations. 
However, the interdisciplinary researcher enters work spaces which are not built by or for them. Where artists use their atelier, designers their studio and scientists their lab for experimentation, testing and collaboration, the embedded researcher enters a traditional, disciplinary university environment.

Therefore this project seeks to investigate and built upon the combined needs for newly established forms of researchs by means of self-reflective research by the combined skills and expertise of the public and private partner. 
The embedded researcher's profile is a short-term research project which seeks to establish sustainable collaborations between the creative industries and universities.

One approach to realize co-creation practices, specifically between public-private-civic partners, is the so-called Living Lab-approach. Living Labs situate ICT development practices in daily life settings to gain insights about unexpected uses of technologies. ICT users, in turn, are not only primarily included in their role of “user”, but also in guises mostly associated with those involved in the design and development process of ICTs. Coupled, the unexpected knowledge ascertained by changing the site of and the people “in” the laboratory is ultimately to lead to the development of more successful innovative ICT products and services. By transforming mundane environments into experimentation areas, interactions – in this case between users and technologies-in-the-making in this environment - become the subject of enquiry for Living Laboratories. “The unexpected” is expected to be found by investigating user-technology interactions. Living Labs can thus be said to adhere to a promise that is not unlike a tagline of a generic blockbuster film, namely to “expect the unexpected”.

But how is the uncovering of the unexpected achieved such co-creative (e)laboratories? Previous insights in the discovery of knowledge in scientific laboratories show how in these controlled environments messy relationships and processes become stabilised and “purified” into “a textual account of nature, and a set of more of less formulaic statements about method” (Law, 2007: 4). Facts are shown to be constructed; Science and Technology Studies scholars such as Latour and Woolgar (1979) trace how sociomaterial interactions in the laboratory become stabilised in accepted facts. Attempting to find unexpected insights in environments that are expressly less controlled and situated in “the living”, suggests that these labs actively seek out open and messy sociomaterial practices in order to find a kind of knowledge “in the wild” (Hutchins, 1995).

While the research area of Living Labs and public-private-civic partnerships is still in its early development, research into open innovation practices in labs that are formed out of public-private-civic partnerships show certain trends pertaining to the inclusion of end users in open innovation practices. For example while these labs may seek to democratize design and development of new ICT products and services, the end user as such is more often than not mainly included as part of the user-centric methodology, not as part of the partnership consortium. This has implications; whereas the promise of democratization and of uncovering unexpected and innovative ideas and practices of end users, locking “the user” into their role of “user” seems to preclude precisely the treatment of this user as an “equal”, providing input during development directly. Users are characterized, for example, as in need of motivation to join in on laboratory activities.

Innovation practices are not easily dividable in clear-cut categories of top down or bottom-up innovation. For example, Daft (1978) observes both processes of top down and bottom-up innovation in organizational innovation. In the same vein, Enkel and colleagues (Enkel, Gassmann, & Chesbrough, 2009) articulate the importance of different flows of knowledge to help establish (open) innovation: outside-in processes, inside-out processes and coupled processes, the latter of which is specifically connected to practices of co-creation. Chesbrough argues that in order to cope with the uncertain success of innovations, companies should open up their innovation processes. Likening the hitherto “traditional” innovation processes of firms to a game of chess, he proposes that in practicing open innovation, companies should instead focus on developing a process for playing poker. This means accepting that successful innovation is very much uncertain and dependent on uncontrollable contextual (in this case market) conditions (Chesbrough, 2004: 25). Be it chess or poker, games start with people who are willing to play. In Living Laboratories, prospective technology users are invited to join the game of open innovation. At the same time, these users are part of the gameplay itself; their inclusion is part of the rulebook. Their actions, ideas and contributions may well be, coupled with the fact that Living Lab-practices are set in a daily life setting, “the uncertain” elements that characterise open innovation in Living Labs. Still, their inclusion is regarded with some ambivalence exactly because of the uncertain outcomes. It is not clear in advance what their contributions will bring to the innovation process.


The interdisciplinary research setting of an embedded researcher in the humanities span not only from one faculty research group to another or between universities but more and more towards involving private partners from the creative industries, thus changes the requirements of how researchers operate.

The work space of the embedded researchers are regular office spaces at the university, supplied with a desk and a computer. The scope of most projects however require a variety of work settings.
When working from a human-centered approach it is crucial to not think of the form of the outcome right away or to be limited to just one medium or technology. But in order to experiment and innovate, a flexible workspace is needed. Artistic expression and creativity do not obey closing hours and bureaucratic sterility of university buildings.

The first result will be a prototype for a research environment for interdisciplinary short term projects. As a test case functions the embedded research track and their participants at the Center for Digitial Humanities and Creative Industries Research Center at the University of Amsterdam, who describe the challenging, but enabling situation and the potentials of the room for experimentation in order to transfer this knowledge onto other interdisciplinary reserach projects. 

Need

- increasing need of knowledge workers to combine theoretical as well as hands-on approaches in their research
- current workspaces do not provide enough space and the right material to experiment


Challenge

The work space of the embedded researchers are regular office spaces at the university, supplied with a desk and a computer. The scope of most projects however require a variety of work settings.
When working from a human-centered approach it is crucial to not think of the form of the outcome right away or to be limited to just one medium or technology. But in order to experiment and innovate, a flexible workspace is needed. Artistic expression and creativity do not obey closing hours and bureaucratic sterility of university buildings.

//Yeehaa: Embedded researcher is a new and exiting role within the university. Its goal is to establish sustainable partnerships between private partners and universities. In practice, however, this turns out to be problematic, since the role and position of this kind of researcher is peripheral by definition. The embedded research usual works on short term projects and inbetween the academy and a company.

We believe that a virtual and physical lab is essential to compensate for the abovementioned problems. An online and offline platform - that already exists before they start, and will start after their contracts end - a space is a necessary precondition for ER project that are actually sustainable. In this project we want to explore how such a lab should look like.//

How could the ideal workspace for knowledge workers within the faculty of the humanities at the UvA look like? How could the working environment be adapted to meet the changed research requirements of knowledge workers at the Departments for Digital Humanities, Media Studies, Cultural Analysis and Artistic Research?

- aims at ﬁnding out about users’s needs via an ethnographic research tools
- synthesizes, narrows insights down to hit the core of a problem
- condensed synthesis enables to start into an ideation part
- generates a broad variety of ideas
- makes ideas tangible in rapid and rough prototypes, cost-efﬁcient development


Future University related research has to be informed by open methodologies. Increasingly funding is spread competitively for small research periods, also in order to foster the collaboration between the public and the private sector, for example in the form of embedded researchers. Even though the emphasis here is on sustainable research, the projects are often closed and presented and not open for further development (unless some additional funding allows to proceed) 
Truely sustainable research is OPEN and would mean that a project has releases - at some point (after the official end of the research period) other students, embedded researchers are allowed and encouraged to take the outcome of the research, alter and develop it further. At some point (after the official end of the research period) other students, embedded researchers are allowed and encouraged to take the outcome of the research, alter and develop it further.

Zur Unterstützung für die Entwicklung eines E-Labs wird parallel ein physisches
Forschungsatelier, ein Living Lab aufgebaut. Dieses befasst sich zum einen mit den
Forschungsprojekten innerhalb des E-Labs und bildet auf der anderen Seite einen Ort, der der
Kollaboration der Studenten und Forscher untereinander dient.
Die Embedded Researcher, die als Pilot-Nutzer dieses Ortes fungieren, testen und verändern
im Living Lab die Schnittstelle zwischen analoger und digitaler Welt und untersuchen die
konkreten Auswirkungen auf die Kollaboration untereinander. Dies wird anhand
prototypischer Änderungen im Raum, digitaler Prototypen und kultureller, prozessualer
Anpassungen untersucht.

#####*Describe any critical risks, relating to project implementation, that the stated project’s objectives may not be achieved. Detail any risk mitigation measures. Please provide a table with critical risks identified and mitigating actions (table 3.2b).*

critical questions to be answered in the proposal:

- How can embedded research projects most effectively be realized when conducted and managed outside of existing organizational units? 
- What is the likelihood of long-term and active participation in the OverLab structure by faculty and (graduate) students? 
- What impact (positive or negative) will the OverLab have on the participating faculties' home academic department? 
- What resources will be required to support the unit, and how will those resources be obtained and managed? 
- To what extent will establishment of the new entity help to attract external support? 

*Questions adjusted from “Rationale and Impact” for Establishing and Managing Independent Laboratories, Institutes and Centers at the Stanford University.* 


#####*Describe, where relevant, how effective innovation management will be addressed  in the management structure and work plan; Innovation management is a process which requires an understanding of both market and technical problems, with a goal of successfully implementing appropriate creative ideas. A new or improved product, service or process is its typical output. It also allows a consortium to respond to an external or internal opportunity.*

Patrick Kenzler (add CV or description of the profile and responsibilities in the project)

Dark Horse is an innovation agency based in Berlin which creates user-centered products and services and helps clients to change their structures, processes and minds. Their work is based on Design Thinking principles and their own unusual working culture that simultaneously stresses ﬂexibility and connections. They design spatial, procedural and social conditions of collaboration in on and offline settings. Guided by their participative design approach, they created spaces and working culture for collaboration in science and creative industry.

Within the proposed project Dark Horse is going to conduct research on and develop of a conceptual framework and design of a physical space that accompanies and complements the online learning platform. Their user centered approach and the background in anthropology and interior design allows Lisa Zoth and Patrick Kenzler to understand and translate the requirements of such a space into a practical design concept and the according user culture. They will provide an answer to the crucial question of how online collaboration and innovative practice can be initiated, accelerated and fostered through an offline setting. Moreover their research will give insights to the students needs that cannot be satisfied merely by the application of ICT but are better addressed with a combination of digital instruments and offline collaboration and training methods.
