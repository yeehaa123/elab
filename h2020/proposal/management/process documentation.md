### OverDoc: Towards a format of cross-medial process documentation 

what? 

- develop further the process documentation and medial communication of larger research projects
- display and exposure of the project 

Deliverables
- cross-medial best practice 
 

how?

- built a bridge between the concrete implementation of video, learning and collecting as one part 
of the overall platform
- use format of Scientific Research Trailer as a point-of-departure
- research which media can be used for science communication in which way


why? reasons for this approach

- this project has a complex structure, uses a variety of technology, adresses and includes different audiences
- to share the knowledge from building the different sub-projects 
- the newly emerged field of eLearning and MOOC's possesses great possibilities for the distribution of knowledge and exchange. However, there are currently few examples of projects or courses where the promises of moving images are used to their fullest, and where the different field of expertise of academic teachers, videographers and students result in products which reflect their research content in the best possible way.

who? 
Johanna Barnbeck investigates the format of Scientific Research Trailer as a way to adequately communicate research practices to relevant audiences. Together with universities and research institutes she produces video sequences which use filmic language and do justice to the respective research topic and people who conduct the research. 

Those films are made for
