# Structure of the problem, principles and projects 

We identify:
+ 4 core problems of learning and inclusion
+ 5 principles to structure the solutions to these problems
+ 3 sub-projects that provide solutions to these problems
+ 9 Implementation choices to construct the solutions

## Dilemmas

1. Literacy: Humanities research and education will increasingly depend on people who know how to read and write programming languages.

2. Organization: Knowledge institutions are rapidly losing their monopoly on education and research.

3. Numbers: Future education and research should revolve around massive numbers (Big Data, MOOC

4. Elite: Coding and knowledge production remain privileges of a cultural, technological and economic elite.

## Principles

1. Training over Support: researchers with limited knowledge of ICT often ask for technical support to offer solutions to their problems. Each time they have a problem, they need support. Training them to build their own tools to address their problems removes the need for support. One top of that, they are better able to understand and reflect on the consequences of using these tools.

2. Collaboration over Onwership: researchers keep data sets and tools developed in projects to themselves. Collaborative projects challenge this attitude by showing the benefits of sharing and reusing. 

3. Online over Massive: Massive Open Online Courses are an attempt to provide education to much larger audiences, thereby making it more inclusive. However, the use of online tools is often limited to copying the traditional model of a broadcast lecture and a number of assignments. The dynamic of teaching and learning remains unchanged and the massive scale forms an obstacle to the need for individual feedback, meaningful assessment, face-to-face collaboration and inspiring and dynamic courses. The potential of online tools is not explored and exploited. We propose a platform that is focused on collaboration and new roles for teachers and students. Users on the platform are learners and researchers at the same time. ...

4. Knowledge Prodcution over Data Processing:

5. Accessibility of State-of-the-Art:


## Sub-projects

1. Platforms as Interfaces:

2. Labs as Interfaces:

3. Collections as Interfaces:


## Implementation Choices

1. Language-based:

2. User-centered:

3. Tool-oriented:

4. Embedded Research:

5. Peer Organisation &amp; Evaluation:

6. Browser First:

7. Webcomponents:

8. JavaScript:

9. Git:
