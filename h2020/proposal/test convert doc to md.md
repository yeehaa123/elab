#1. Excellence

## 1.1 Objectives 

Learning and research (in the Humanities) are hindered by a lack of 
coding skills and the seeming incommensurability of educating massive groups 
of students and providing high quality education. Although traditional knowledge 
institutions are losing their monopoly on education and research, ICT skills 
and knowledge production remain privileges of a cultural, technological and economic 
elite. We propose to tackle this problem by providing online and offline interfaces 
between people on the one hand and learning and research on the other hand, which 
focus on new forms of collaboration and a user- and tool-oriented approach to 
learning programming skills. These interfaces lower the technological, economic 
and organizational barriers to participation, empower many different groups of 
people to more deeply and effectively engage with technology and motivate lifelong 
learning.

We identify four dilemmas about statements on learning and research that can be 
challenged or embraced:

1. *Digital Literacy*: Education and research (in the Humanities) increasingly depend on people with programming skills.
2. *Organization*: Traditional knowledge institutions are losing their monopoly on education and research.
3. *Numbers*: Future education should revolve around massive numbers (Big Data, MOOC).
4. *Elite*: Coding and knowledge production remain privileges of a cultural, technological and economic elite.


### Problems and Projects

Our answer to these dilemmas provide the following objectives:

1. The goal to heighten digital literacy. We want to increase the number of people who approach learning and research collaboratively, through an online platform where users learn programming and build tools, thereby increasing digital literacy and at the same time lowering the technological threshold to engage with and reflect on digital tools. 

2. The goal of organization. We intend to create interfaces for users to teach each other and learn and research collaboratively, out of their own motivation, but use institutional structures to kick-start this process and provide disciplinary contexts.

3. The goal of strengthening numbers. We want to increase the number of people learning and researching by focusing on collaboration and sharing knowledge, so that individual approaches and feedback remain possible, thereby retaining high quality education. 

4. The goal of addressing the issue of the elite. We want to make learning and research accessible and relevant by offering interfaces that allow many different types of users to learn to use and do research with technology 

These objectives present learning and inclusion as problems of interfaces. By definition, interfaces determine who or what is included and excluded. The focus of this project is thus on providing interfaces that increase inclusion, where users build, explore and reflect on digital tools and how we use them. The overarching goal is to weave technology and humanities together to foster innovation through three forums: an expandable platform for humanities students collaborate through coding, a lab space where humanities thinking influences product and business design, and an exhibition which engages technology, art, business, and humanities. We propose to do this in three parts:

1. *Platform as interface*: an expandable platform for humanities students to collaboratively learn programming and build tools for their research. The coding platform would develop new courses with both on and offline components. Our goal is to introduce four new courses of 12 ETCs, one each year. The new courses would enable Coding the Humanities to expand students’ introduction to programming to an open space where they would collaborate with people from all over the world in their ICT engagement. It would foster communication among students and other participants by serving as a space where they can share and experiment with findings, improvise together, and enjoy the thrill of new learning with a network of support. The goal in terms of inclusion would be to reach 20,000 users in four years. The University of Amsterdam would begin by including four other universities in this platform, linking the students through the coursework. The University of California Santa Barbara, University of California Irvine, and Humboldt University of Berlin are highly motivated to take part in this platform. 

2. *Lab as interface*: The lab space would be an offline physical space in Amsterdam where students could work together with private partners to create new products and services that involve humanities thinking; applying a humanities perspective to practical applications outside academia. Our goal is to create one new product or service per year that meets a need within the humanities, and one new product or service per year that meets a need for a more general or different audience.

3. *Collections as interfaces*: The exhibition would be a combination of on and offline projects, culminating in a public six week exhibition in the Museum Square in Vienna three years into the project. We endeavor to involve students from the platform, partners from the lab space, as well as other private and public partners, developers, and the general population. This exhibition would consist of workshops, data events, speakers, art installations, and presentations on relationships between ITC, art, business, and cultural heritage.

### Problems and Principles

We also challenge the traditional educational dichotomy of researchers as experts and students as novices. Learning and research are hard to separate as both revolve around involve producing and sharing knowledge, where each participant can be both the sender and receiver of knowledge. This leads us to five principles which will guide our implementation of these interfaces:

1. *Training over support*: Our first core value is training so that a learner will soon be able to pass on the knowledge to another learner. While support can result in repeatedly assisting the same person with the same issue, maintaining a distinction and even hierarchy in skillsets, training provides experience to the learner to bring them to an equal level to the trainer.
2. *Collaboration over ownership*: Related to training over support is our second core principle, which favors collaborative over competitive efforts. Owning processes and results together on an equal basis promotes great teamwork.
3. *Online over Massive*: The format of the platform encourages students to first learn coding online, but intends them to also have a physical team within their institution. This complements the Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) concept, which includes only an online context for learning.
4. *Knowledge production over data processing*: <explanation>
5. *Accessibility over state-of-the-art*: Our fifth core value is that of tools that are less complicated to begin to use over those that are state-of-the-art. Whereas state-of-the-art tools attract primarily the technically biased, more accessible tools have the power to reach a wider group of new users, including the non-technically biased. This supports our goal of inclusion of traditionally and currently underrepresented populations in ICT.

Coding the Humanities is already a strong and unique research project in Amsterdam (UvA, VU, HvA) that has been successfully running for over one year. Closely linked to projects such as zooniverse, dh, data drive, AAA, chat, and circa, Coding the Humanities explores interplay between humanities and technology. We engage traditionally non-technically biased students with technology in order to empower them to proactively create their own tools, as well as to more deeply and holistically reflect on those tools. We aim to extend beyond the coursework currently offered in order to connect humanities students to artistic, cultural, and business institutions. 

To enrich these courses and enhance the analysis of the coding platform's processes and results, we seek funding from other sources to offer two PhD positions related to relationships between humanities and technology. These positions would be excellent additions to the project, whose primary focus is to create new products and services and support research and development activities. Each project will address a key aspect of the overall objective to foster connections between technology and humanities.

The first project will address the Physical Lab element, and will involve a PhD student working part-time as an embedded researcher in a separate institution. The project will investigate sustainable forms of knowledge transfer and creative and collaborative work practices in combined digital and physical learning environments.

The second project would relate to the core project of the coding platform. The PhD student would research how to reflect on tools through coding. S/he would conceptualize, plan, monitor, and program the coding platform. This PhD would serve as a way of measuing the development and success of the platform over four years. This researcher will be well integrated into the context of the university's department of digital humanities, and will also collaborate with private and public partners.



**1.2 Relation to the Work Programme**

\

Indicate the work programme topic to which your proposal relates, and
explain how your proposal addresses the specific challenge and scope of
that topic, as set out in the work programme.

\

The project proposed fits the work programme "Platform for ICT for
Learning and Inclusion" as it seeks to initiate a dialogue between
university scholars and students, artists, knowledge institutions and
private companies about the potential merits of ICT for new forms of
teaching, learning, knowledge production and transfer.

\

The dialogue will be initiated on and around a open online learning and
collaboration platform that allows students, researchers but also the
general public in an hands on approach to shape ICT and discuss ICT
related issues. The platform seeks to train students and researchers to
understand and shape the digital tools surrounding them. The open design
of this interface encourages them to pass on the tools they created and
the knowledge they generated.

\

The exchange on the use of and knowledge about ICT in research and
education will be further advanced by an offline lab that accompanies
the online platform. In this space, that explores the interplay of on-
and offline collaborations, workshops, hackathons and presentations are
set up to point the attention of a broad audience towards ICT as a means
to enhance knowledge production and encourage them to participate on the
online platform itself.

\

Finally the software projects, insights of students, private and public
partners will feed into a 6 week exhibition in Vienna on the engagement
of ICT and knowledge production addressing a large audience and engaging
them in workshops. The documentation of the exihibition will be openly
accessible online.

\

Thus this project aims at providing a platform that equips its users
with agency concerning the application of ICT for knowledge production,
in order to increase the overall amount of people that can join ICT
related discussions.

\

The members of the consortium combine a broad expertise that allows to
explore how ICT can enhance humanities research and education, how these
insights can help knowledge institutions to make their heritage more
accessible and understandable for a larger public and how these
knowledge can inspire SMEs for the development of new products and
services.

\

The consortium will provide training and consultation to humanities
students, researchers and scholars. It will generate models and
strategies concerning the use and development of ICT for teaching and
education in an online and offline context that are valuable to other
universities, public institutions and companies.

\

In order to involve a large number of students, researcher, scholars but
also non-technology biased people in general terms, the platform reaches
out to other universities, knowledge institutions and private partners
alike in order to initiate a dialogue about new forms of education that
not only integrates ICT but empowers a large number of people to use and
shape these technologies to their specific needs. Due to the open
licenses used the digital tools developed by the students can be applied
and altered also by social institutions, civic movements or the general
public.

\

**1.3 Concept and approach, quality of the coordination and support
measures**

\

**1.3.1 Introduction**

\

Many humanities students and scholars are reluctant to learn new
technologies, and thereby limit both their own ability to influence the
outside world, as well as the incorporation of technology in their
research. As Mitch Resnick has said, not being able to take charge of
the technological tools we use to meet our own particular needs is
similar to being able only to read a language but not write. For full
use of the language and to use it to express ourselves, we must also be
able to use it to create new structures. To make full use of
technologies, we must be able not just to use them passively, but to
modify them. This venture will empower humanities students and scholars
to proactively drive their own learning and research. When they engage
with technology through coding, they open the doors to master and
innovate their own tools.

\

The coding platform will build upon Coding the Humanities, an already
strong research project at the University of Amsterdam that has been
successfully running for more than a year. Coding the Humanities is
closely linked to several other projects, including zooniverse, dh,
chat, and circa, and explores interplay between humanities and
technology within the humanities faculty. It currently introduces
programming to humanities students through coursework. We have three
courses that are incorporated into the curriculum on programming basics.
The course "Art, Science, and Technology" is running now, and the
courses "Coding the Humanities" and "From Objected Data" will both begin
in September 2014. Increasing the number of humanities students and
scholars with programming skills through this coding platform will allow
them to shape and create digital tools that meet their particular
research needs and encourage new forms of learning, teaching and
knowledge production. This skillset will sensitize the participants to
their technological environment and make them aware of the challenges
and opportunities ICT offers for humanities research. Coding knowledge
makes those in the humanities more employable because humanities
students and scholars will increasingly need to be able to read and
write code. Expanding the context beyond the classroom to the coding
platform will give students a venue to connect and share with
participants outside the university.

\

**1.3.2 Assumptions involved**

\

There is an assumption in society that academia is separate from the
rest of the world, and that the two cannot interact; we intend to break
down this constructed notion and open channels for the two to connect.
More specifically, we address the assumption that humanities students
and scholars are separate from the hard sciences and technology,
endeavoring to bring the two together.

\

At the present time, universities face a loss of authority and control
over their own knowledge production as models of traditional education
are being replicated in online formats. Transfering the classroom into
online formats does no justice to the possibilities provided by online
tools in terms of peer learning, collaboration, and exchange that
abandons the dichotomy of experts and layman.

\

**1.3.3 Approach**

\

This research proposal consists of three integrated action fields in
which public-private-civic partnerships (quad-helix) lead to a sharing
of expertise and collaborative practices geared at the development of a
cutting-edge innovative educational ecosystem that is specific to the
(digital) humanities but reaches beyond this realm. These fields are
socio-technical in their approach; apart from combining insights from
different partners to develop technological solutions (such as an online
educational platform), valorize existing and new R&D methodologies (such
as design thinking methodologies and embedded research practices) and
the translation of data streams and information in intuitive interfaces
that make use of visualization, this research proposal seeks to
specially gear technological developments and efforts to enhance society
by closing the digital divide. By collaborating throughout the project
with public, private and civic partners, the project foresees the
accumulation of knowledge and a digital skilling of particular hitherto
unreached civic groups.

\

These efforts should be viewed in line with two overarching developments
in contemporary society and in humanities‚Äô research; the move to create
smart cities where citizens are digitally empowered and the development
of digital humanities. By integrating the digital skilling of citizens
with the agenda of the development of digital humanities, the project
aims to perform academic research through a digital inclusion
methodology/practice. Practically, the envisioned educational platform
realizes local engagement, user-focused learning with both an
individually-oriented as well as collective component; collaboration and
the accumulation of knowledge and skills are key to a successful
implementation of the platform.

\

Each of the three areas anticipates and addresses an upcoming challenge.

\

**\
 1.3.3.1 The Platform as Interface**

\

In order to initiate a fruitful debate about the development and
application of ICT it is crucial not only to start that debate among ICT
experts. On the contrary, this debate should evolve around users and
their needs. Thus one of the main challenges to face for the creation of
a sustainable dialogue about the opportunities ICT offers is to interest
and educate non-technologically biased persons, meaning those who are
not inclined to use and develop ICT.

\

CtH pursues this goal by addressing humanities students and at the same
time provides an online learning interface that reaches out to
non-technologically biased people in general by lowering the threshold
to engage with ICT. This platform therefore opens up the closed
university realm for the education up to bigger numbers and overcomes
the limitation of ICT training to a cultural, technological and
economical elite.

\

Whereas classical digital humanities programs often rely ICT experts
that develop programs for the humanities and provide for supportive
actions for the implementation of these tools, coding the humanities
seeks to train the students and researchers themselves to shape ICT and
understand the possibilities the tools they hold in their hands offer.
Hereby the online platform intends to enlarge the circle of people that
are involved in the development of ICT beyond the small group of
experts.

\

The platform provides an "online first" approach which means that the
students find the means to learn coding and work collaboratively online
first through courses and tutorials but can complement these tools with
offline meetings. This approach avoids the mere transfer of offline
teaching methods into the online world, which is a typical weakness of
many Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), but explores what offline
collaboration can be informed by strategies applied with online tools
and how innovative offline practices can initiate and foster online
cooperation. It seeks to provide students with the technological
foundations to acquire and develop these skills by themselves and in
peer learning based processes, based on tutorials and assignments

\

CtH projects are produced and stored under open licenses which
encourages the collaboration and reuse of the software tools by other
institutions, companies or partners and therefore provides. These
platform in this sense triggers direct debate on the status of ICT in
the humanities.

\

In times of big data more and more data is available but not necessary
turned into knowledge. The Coding the Humanities platform educates
students, researchers and non-technologically biased people on how to
approach this data. It allows its participants to gain insights by
addressing these dataset. The CtH projects and tools are therefore
easily relateable to already existing open data movements - it seeks to
provide its users with digital agency that evolves into debates on open
data.

\

The platform will embrace open source culture and open licenses. The
students share their code projects on a distributed repository which
encourages re-use, altering and further development. This platform is
therefore open, inclusive and sustainable.

\

**Technical approach**

\

On the technical side the design of the platform is inspired by and
makes use of open source software and the attached collaborative
strategies.

\

Users make a profile on GitHub, an online public platform for
maintaining and sharing repositories that has distributed version
control (each user has access to all versions of all documents in the
project and can modify existing projects). Their profiles contain all
their work, every single contribution to their repositories, which
encourages sharing and reuse but also provides them with a portfolio
which shows their skills. This portfolio increases the employability of
humanities students in addition to serving as a documentation site.

\

The platform is developed in JavaScript, which will also be the main
programming language that is used on the platform. JavaScript is the
language that is used on most websites and in all modern web browsers to
let the user interact with the web. The advantage of using JavaScript is
that it gives users access to the full stack of technologies:
client-side, server-side and database levels can be controlled with
JavaScript. With it, programmers can interact with data on any website
and any web platform. JavaScript also combines the major programming
paradigms, so users switching to other programming languages will
recognise many elements and don't need to start from scratch.

\

All interaction with the platform is done via the web browser. All
modern browsers allow users to directly interact with web sites and
servers through the browser console using JavaScript. Thereby users can
directly apply their coding skills to anything they encounter on the
web. Another advantage is that this minimises the threshold to
developing and using programming skills, as web browsers are found on
most computers and are provided by default with all popular operating
systems. At the same time, using JavaScript in the browser exposes users
to the full range of programming possibilities.

\

Furthermore, the platform is tool oriented. Students develop small tools
and widgets that perform small parts of the research they want to
conduct. The reason to focus on tools is that researchers in general and
humanities scholars in particular need to reflect critically on the
tools they use for their research. By becoming proficient at
conceptualising and developing tools, scholars develop a keen eye for
perceiving how digital tools work in general.

\

Developments in programming languages have shifted the focus from
computation to language. Commands in modern programming languages are
more like natural language expressions, whereas older languages forced
programmers to formulate very algebraic commands. This makes modern
languages more intuitive to use, which lowers the threshold and together
with the vast number of interesting JavaScript modules available on the
web, even novice programmers can build interesting applications in a
matter of hours or days instead of months or years. Promoting
programming skills to a large audience makes more sense now than ever
before.

\

**User Experience**

\

The users of the platform will acquire programming skills via modular
online courses and tutorials with direct visual feedback and the ability
to concurrently work on the same code and copy and comment on each
others work in real-time. This approach encourages peer learning and
collaboration.

\

The platform is set up in such a way that universities can integrate
learning modules from CtH in their curriculum, while students can build
up their portfolios through research projects, with which they can show
both their progress to teachers and their skills and achievements to
(future) employers. Furthermore, as was indicated about the application,
it integrates naturally with Github and other open source environments,
lowering the threshold for a diverse audience to reuse, copy and extend
the prototypes, products and results of interest to society, including
the general public, academics and companies.

\

The platform will be introduced to students for the University of
Amsterdam with an accompanying offline course that allows students to
earn ECT points. This phase will be followed by public release.

\

**1.3.3.2 The Lab as Interface**

\

Universities are opening up towards other universities, civic movements
and companies, so that other groups can benefit from and enrich their
knowledge.

\

This process of opening up can be accelerated by spaces that are
situated in between the involved actors. The "living lab" we propose
shows how this can lead to innovation. The physical lab provices a space
for embedded research, a place for "overlapping", theory and artistic
practice, physical and digital research, of studio, workshop, library,
of institutions - private and public, an independent place

\

**Introduction**

\

One of the challenges concerning new forms of online learning is to form
a community of participants that are interested to engage with a
platform over a longer period of time and actively contribution to
sustainable projects. This sub-project addresses these challenges by the
design and production of an offline living lab as interface between
digital and analogue world.

\

As a user-driven methodology, Living Labs aim to blur the boundaries
between technology users and producers by including (future) users of
technologies from the start of technology development. Positioning users
as co-creators reverses traditional ‚Äútop-down‚Äù R&D-processes performed
by companies in favour of ‚Äúbottom-up‚Äù innovation, performed by users and
grounded in society instead of in research laboratories. This practice
is to lead to unexpected insights into user ideas and practices
(Almirall, 2008: 43 Almirall, E. (2008). Living Labs and Open
Innovation: Roles and Applicability. The Electronic Journal for Virtual
Organizations and Networks, 10(August), 21‚Äì46) and lead to the
development of more successful ICTs. To gain unexpected insights,
methodologies focus on the inclusion of real (end) users in daily life
contexts. The Living Lab thus also comprises a setting; a setting that
affords ‚Äúexperimentation environments in which technology is given shape
in real life context and in which (end) users are considered
co-producers‚Äù (Ballon et al., 2005: 13 Ballon, P., Delaere, S., Pierson,
J., M, P., Slot, M., Bierhof, J., & Diocaretz, M. (2005). Test &
Experimentation Platforms for Broadband Innovation: Conceptualizing and
Benchmarking International Best Practice).

\

This living lab, the OverLab, will explore the integration and
complementation of ICT based learning and collaboration into an offline
environment. It will serve as a testbed to initiate, support and foster
online ICT projects. At the same time, the strategies and practices of
the analogue space inform the development of the digital platform.
Innovative perspectives on the application of ICT in general and its
integration into an offline space will be explored through experimental,
user focused workshops that result in a physical space. The conception
and design of the lab according to user needs is a crucial part within
this subproject. This approach will produce models and concepts for the
design and user culture of a living lab that feeds of and informs the
online learning platform. The process will be openly documented and
intends the imitation and formation of living labs related to the coding
the humanities platform.

\

The initial users of this interface are researchers that are situated in
between a variety of aspects themselves: Embedded researchers work
between theory and (artistic) practice, physical and digital research,
science and art, universities and public or private partners. Their
needs as digital knowledge worker on the one hand and a specific but
homogeneous group on the other hand, allow valuable insights concerning
the question of how ICT can provide instruments to make research more
open, accessible and sustainable.

\

It will be an independent place outside the department structure of the
university in which studio, workshop and library intertwine, a room that
enables and allows to experiment.

Embedded researcher is a new and exciting role within the university.
Its goal is to establish sustainable partnerships between private
partners and universities. In practice, however, this turns out to be
problematic, since the role and position of this kind of researcher is
peripheral by definition. The embedded researcher usually works on short
term projects and in between the academy and a company which seeks to
establish sustainable collaborations between the creative industries and
universities. Though the future of research lies more and more in
collaborations between disciplines and fields, between public and
private partnerships, practice and theory, between classic methodology
and flexible theory, co-creation and collaborations the
interdisciplinary researcher enters work spaces which are not built by
or for them and uses methodology and means of exposure which remain in
the respective fields.

\

Where artists use their atelier, designers their studio and scientists
their lab for experimentation, testing and collaboration, the embedded
researcher enters a traditional, disciplinary university environment
even though they are often expected to address research questions with a
practical and creative research aspect. But artistic expression and
creativity do not obey closing hours and bureaucratic sterility of
university buildings.

\

A virtual and physical lab is essential to compensate for the
aforementioned problems. An online and offline platform - that already
exists before they start, and will start after their contracts end - a
space is a necessary precondition for embedded research projects that
are actually sustainable. In this project we want to explore how such a
lab should look like. Therefore this project seeks to investigate and
built upon the combined needs for newly established forms of research by
means of self-reflective research by the combined skills and expertise
of the public and private partner using design thinking.

\

Therefore this project seeks to investigate and built upon the combined
needs for newly established forms of research by means of
self-reflective research by the combined skills and expertise of the
public and private partner using design thinking. When working from a
human-centered approach it is crucial to not think of the form of the
outcome right away or to be limited to just one medium or technology.
But in order to experiment and innovate, a flexible workspace is as much
needed as a fl∆íexible methodological framework which stimulates creating
research designs with specific tools.

\

Challenge The work space of the embedded researchers are regular office
spaces at the university, supplied with a desk and a computer. The scope
of most projects however requires a variety of work settings. When
working from a human-centered approach it is crucial to not think of the
form of the outcome right away or to be limited to just one medium or
technology. But in order to experiment and innovate, a flexible
workspace is needed. Artistic expression and creativity do not obey
closing hours and bureaucratic sterility of university buildings. How
could the ideal workspace for knowledge workers look like? How could the
working environment be adapted to meet the changed research requirements
of knowledge workers at the Departments for Digital Humanities, Media
Studies, Cultural Analysis and Artistic Research? How can these physical
structures create a sustainable link with an online learning
environment? And how can the analogue and digital workspaces best be
linked to each other?

\

How to: user-centered approach Design Thinking aims at Ô¨Ånding out about
users‚Äôs needs via an ethnographic research tools, synthesizes, narrows
insights down to hit the core of a problem, condensed synthesis enables
to start into an ideation part generates a broad variety of ideas, makes
ideas tangible in rapid and rough prototypes, cost-efÔ¨Åcient development

\

Future University related research has to be informed by open
methodologies. Increasingly funding is spread competitively for small
research periods, also in order to foster the collaboration between the
public and the private sector, for example in the form of embedded
researchers. Even though the emphasis here is on sustainable research,
the projects are often closed and presented and not open for further
development (unless some additional funding allows to proceed) Truely
sustainable research is OPEN and would mean that a project has releases
- at some point (after the official end of the research period) other
students, embedded researchers are allowed and encouraged to take the
outcome of the research, alter and develop it further. At some point
(after the official end of the research period) other students, embedded
researchers are allowed and encouraged to take the outcome of the
research, alter and develop it further.

\

There is an increasing need of knowledge workers to combine theoretical
as well as hands-on approaches in their research. Current workspaces do
not provide enough space, the right material, or the appropriate
technology to experiment. It is also essential to have a methodological
framework for researching interdisciplinary methodology, as well as best
practice for building sustainable public-private-partnerships

\

**1.3.3.3 Collections as Interfaces**

\

Collection as an interface: the exploration of the opportunities
interfaces and visualization of data holds for knowledge production and
inclusion

\

There are not only dramatic geographic differences in accessibility to
and user skills of ICT but also socio-economic and demographic gaps.
Vast societal groups face the problem of digital exclusion.
Accessibility to and digital literacy about ICTs determine whether a
person is included into economic, social and cultural life, and whether
they can participate in decision making processes within the democratic
realm. In other words, using and comprehending ICT is about agency and
inclusion. With regard to the growing impact of ICT not only on economic
productivity but also within the cultural, social and political realm,
this exclusion forms a challenge in terms of equality, inclusion and
chances of participation.

\

One area in which the challenge of digital literacy and exclusion is
prominent is within humanities research. Academia is increasingly
confronted with large amounts of data. In order to turn this data into
information and into knowledge, researchers and students need tools that
allow to structure, search, correlate, analyze, but most importantly,
present and visualize this data. This is also true for working fields
related to the humanities: museums, libraries and archives are
challenged to make the huge data sets that result from digitalization of
the cultural heritage they foster, accessible and understandable for as
many people as possible. Despite the opportunities these mass resources
generated in numerous digitization projects provide, humanities
researchers and students are ‚Äì due to a lack of skills - reluctant to
exploit these troves.

\

At the same time, governments, municipalities and cultural institutions
increasingly share their data openly online. A good example of this
development in the field of cultural heritage is our partner in this
project the Europeana network. But also in the political field a lot of
open data sets wait be explored by dedicated citizen. The skills to
compile graspable information from big data sets therefore become more
important on the level of politics and social agency. It allows civic
movements but also single citizens to understand political and social
processes, identify problems and develop solutions ‚Äì that can be
software based.

\

Coding the Humanities trains students and researchers to read and handle
data streams and shows possible ways to translate these into
visualizations. Visualizations such as cartography, timelines, graphs,
diagrams or animations, as well as the design of interactive interfaces
help to translate data into knowledge by providing a context for
different information and a combination of different data sets. This
approach can boost humanities research and at the same time it makes
humanities concepts and research productive and understandable for a
broader audience as the visual translation of the data can inspire the
mind to new insights.

\

In practice, the choice is made to encourage researchers to first learn
to program in JavaScript; JavaScript has a low threshold for the
practical application of code in various fields. Here the researchers
can also experiment with and apply their knowledge to existing open code
resources. In addition to this, existing visualization applications and
programs - such as cartography, timelines, graphs, diagrams or
animations - are made available to humanities‚Äô researchers. Combining
newly developed JavaScript coding skills with enhanced visualization
applications literacy, allows humanities‚Äô researchers to elicit new
knowledge and scientific insights by experimenting with existing
JavaScript libraries such as D3 (Data Driven Documents) while also
gaining good control over the visual outcome of their research
endeavors. These tools thus enhance the analysis and understanding of
complex relations and concepts relevant to humanities‚Äô research. At the
same time data sets become comprehensible and presentable to a broader
audience. Supported by private partners in the consortium, researchers
will also develop new tools that may be applied to different open data
sets, provided by cultural institutions and organizations.

\

The developed tools can be applied to different data sets. Especially
with regard to the above mentioned open data sets provided by more and
more cultural institutions and organizations, data visualization tools
provide a great foundation for collaborative activities between
universities and other institutions. These tools allow to exceed the
mode of mere data processing to the actual production of new insights
and knowledge.

\

Practically, the foreseen educational platform realizes local
engagement, user-focused learning with both an individually-oriented as
well as collective component; collaboration and the accumulation of
knowledge and skills are key to a successful implementation of the
platform. Apart from a digital educational platform and the realization
of a physical research space where public-private-civic partners can
collaborate, a third component of the project is the translation of data
in intuitive interfaces and data visualization. Students and researchers
(‚Äúusers‚Äù) will be taught to translate data into visualization, thereby
not only learning how to interpret data, but also how to code and
reflect on what coding practices mean; how the act of coding influences
how data is represented. Users, in this way, become more aware of how
data may be manipulated while at the same time gaining skills that
empower the user. By learning how to read and handle data streams and
how these may be translated in visualizations, users therefore not only
gain skills, but also become more empowered, ‚Äúsmart‚Äù users. Moreover,
data visualization tools provide a great foundation for collaborative
activities between universities and other institutions; these tools move
beyond the mode of mere data processing to instead produce new insights
and knowledge.

\

The project thus involves visualization and interface expertise of
private partners to not merely facilitate and realize skilling of
humanities‚Äô researchers, but to moreover stimulate new knowledge
production. Directly connected to this is the fact that the consortium
is complemented by open data collections provided by cultural
institutions. These open data collections provide research material for
humanities researchers to interact with, to investigate and to draw new
knowledge from.

\

This also relates to the second part of the Collection as Interfaces
sub-project; the research performed by consortium of actors will
culminate in a public six week exhibition, situated in Vienna in the
third year of the project. Involving and drawing from the research
practices of students on the platform, the partners in the lab, as well
as other private and public partners, developers and the general
population, the exhibition publicly presents workshops, art
installations and events about the relationship between ICT, art,
business and cultural heritage.

\

The exhibition would be a combination of on and offline projects
complemented by workshops, data events, speakers, art installations, and
presentations on relationships between ITC, art, business, and cultural
heritage. Situated in public space, the exhibition invites the public to
engage with art work, developed interfaces, and visualizations which are
the result of researchers‚Äô efforts in researching open data provided by
cultural institutions.

\

The exhibition will be presented in the third year of the project.
However, at the end of the first year, a trial event will be organized
in Vienna, where first results are to be presented. Between the first
and third year, the consortium will work on realizing the six week
exhibition through crowdfunding mechanisms, such as kickstarter.¬†

\

**Consortium**

\

In this research field we work with the Dutch company Weyeser with
expertise in supporting organizations to translate big amounts of data
into knowledge by means of data mining, machine learning and
visualization. Their solutions offer governments, governmental
institutions, universities, think tanks and corporations ways of
objectively assessing their knowledge portfolio and that of their peers.
Within the framework of CtH, Weyeser supports humanities students in the
analysis and visualization of humanities‚Äô related data sets relevant to
their research.

\

Weyeser‚Äôs expertise with visualization and interfacing-practices is
complemented by the Austrian company CastYourArt. CastYourArt is focused
on consulting, production and online/offline distribution of audio and
video material in which they present artists, exhibitions and collectors
and take art out of the museum context.

\

Moreover, the consortium in this research field will be completed by a
public partner, the Europeana network, which will initiate projects that
encourage students to work with the datasets related to their
collection. In a series of workshops with the private and the public
partner the students will learn about the status quo of visualization
within the museums context. With their humanities background the
students are predestined to comprehend how to turn data into a narrative
and how to meet the demands of the visitor. With their coding skills and
the support of the private partner, the students will collective
conceptualize and develop software solutions for this field but not
limited to this field. The outcome of this project will be accessible
and free to use by other students, scholars, cultural institutions or
civic movements.

\

Visualization empowers the students to make the increasing number of
large datasets productive for their research. The new perspectives
gained also provide arguments and strategies for a larger audience
ranging from museums to foundations to civic movements.

\

Describe any national or international research and innovation
activities which will be linked with the project, especially where the
outputs from these will feed into the project;

\

The proposed projects will connect to the Amsterdam Centre for Digital
Humanities in terms of shared seminars and benefit from the
collaborations with scholars that have insights research concerning
tools for humanities research. Furthermore Coding the Humanities will
benefit from research and network of the Creative Research Centre
Amsterdam to connect with SMEs of the creative industries sector to
collaborate on the development of innovative products and services.
Collaboration with Material Encounters with Digital Cultural Heritage
(meSch) is a highly likely possibility, as the UvA is already involved
in this project. It is a four year European Union funded project based
in the United Kingdom that aims to co-design novel platforms for the
creation of tangible exhibits at heritage sites. Curators will be able
to offer visitors new interactive experiences through material
interaction with smart objects.

\

Additionally, V-MusT.net could be a potential network to collaborate
with. It is a network of excellence that focuses on virtual museums,
endeavoring to provide the heritage sector with the tools and support to
develop virtual museums that are educational, enjoyable, long-lasting
and easy to maintain.

\

The overall approach to this project is to stimulate both
self-empowerment and at the same time, collaboration, between those
working in the humanities those outside academia. This will be done by
offering PhD positions, encouraging embedded research activities, and
working together with Design Thinking companies for fruitful interaction
in the physical lab. There is already an extensive amount of
coordination between the University of Amsterdam and outside
institutions for this project. Productive meetings with several
companies have taken place, including Dark Horse.

Where relevant, describe how sex and/or gender analysis is taken into
account in the project‚Äôs content.

\

This project is about empowering people to use technology, concentrating
on those who are hesitant or face obstacles to do so. Girls and women
overall face greater obstacles to accessing technology and education in
general. Raising awareness of this issue, fostering discussion on
feminism and coding, and working to create new ways of increasing the
participation of girls and women in coding are all essential elements to
our project.

\

Previously unmet needs that can be met by bringing sex and gender into
the research:¬†

-addressing the roots of the divide between women and men in
technology.¬†

- equipping more girls and women with coding skills will enable them to
create tools that they need, which have been overlooked in the
male-dominated world of coding and technology in general.

\

The number of woman attracted by coding within CtH could be increased by
collaborations with initiatives that seek to do the same - increase the
number of female coders, like Railsgirls or geekettes in forms of
workshops, information evenings in the lab.

A recent EU study shows that only 30% of the people in the ICT sector in
Europe are women, a number that mirrors the low number of women with a
degree in that field. Digital Agenda: Bringing more women into EU
digital sector would bring ‚Ç¨9 billion annual GDP boost, EU study shows
While the same study shows the potential of having more woman working in
that field traditional ICT programs fail to attract female students. At
the same time female students in the humanities outnumber male students.
Thus an approach like CtH holds enormous potential to engage more women
in ICT via their research interests. The seminar Coding the Humanities
at the University of Amsterdam has shown that, in combination with tools
relevant to their research, woman are as keen as men to engage with
coding.

\

\

**2. Impact**

****\

**2.1 Expected impacts**

\

The main goal of the project is to reach and train a large number of
humanities students, researchers and scholars and initiate collaboration
through coding projects and a debate about the digital tools in use.
This goal will be pursued through active involvement of students and
researchers on the online interface, the use of the offline lab,
collaborations with universities, organizations and private partners.

\

On a larger scope the project will provide an online learning platform
that is freely accessible and contains collection digital tools that can
be re-used, adapted or developed further. The platform therefore holds
the potential of enabling and equipping a large number of
non-technologically biased people to use these and other tools according
to their needs. In order make this project known to potentially
digitally excluded persons Coding the Humanities seeks to facilitate
collaborations with diverse partners, such as knowledge institutes,
civic movements and municipals.

\

This hands on approach will train thousands of humanities students to
develop digital agency and at the same time seeks to interests many
potentially digitally excluded persons and train them to collaboratively
expand their coding skills and to pass on this knowledge. Every active
user therefore become a collaborator and multiplyer.

\

**Targets**

\

As concrete targets we intent to:

\

- have 20.000 active users of the online platform after four years

- have at least 50 regular users of the physical lab

- have the model of the lab implemented by at least four other public or
private institutions

- reach at least 1000 people workshops, presentations, hackathons with
varying levels of technological knowledge

- to give presentations together with the private partners on at least 5
conferences / symposiums per year

- involve international digital/media artists and reach and involve
hundreds of visitors of the fare for digital devices in Vienna in 2017

\

**Reaching these goals**

****\

**University of Amsterdam**

\

The three offline courses "Art, Science, and Technology", "Coding the
Humanities", "From Object to Data" initiate the participation on the
platform with 20 students per course, 60 students in total in 2014 and
create a awareness of the project before the official release.

\

In the following years four courses (12 ECT) per year starting 2015 will
reach 320 students. These students are meant to work as tutors and pass
on their knowledge to other humanities students and engage with them in
projects based on their research interests.

\

During the same time 40 embedded researchers will use the online
interface and the pilot and the actual physical lab. The experience
gained for the work within this analogue and digital collaborative
space, naturally integrates into their research which is aimed at
modeling a product or service for a cultural institution with regard to
the digital enhancement the services.

\

**Best practice models for other universities and organizations**

\

Collaborations with at least four other universities with humanities
departments equal in size to that of the faculty of humanities of the
University of Amsterdam (7.000 students) will introduce the platform on
an international level to a large goup of humanities students and
scholars. These universities integrate the platform into their
curriculum. Coding the Humanities will provide scholars from the other
universities with consultation on the implementation of the platform in
the coursework.

\

The success of these collaborations can be directly measured through the
number of participating students and of their portfolios on github.
Among the involved humanities scholars an active exchange about the
integration of the platform into their teaching will be initiated and
curated by Coding the Humanities communications staff.

\

Coding the Humanities will furthermore reach out to initiatives like the
open knowledge foundation, railsgirls and research centers like the
Creative Industries Research Centre Amsterdam and Centre for Digital
Humanities Amsterdam to diversify and enlarge the usergroup further.

\

**Public and Private Partners**

\

The direct cooperation with different SMEs will allow for the
co-development of products and services and thus include another
perspective into the digital tools needed in humanities teaching and
education.

\

**Events**

\

All findings, for example in form of reports, presentation, videos,
design blueprints, and the code generated in the project will be
documented and accessible online. The project manager of Coding the
Humanities will initiate a series of events that points the awareness
groups with various levels of technical knowledge to these tools and the
interface itself. Furthermore, the project will be presented at various
conferences, symposia and conventions in the field of education and
software.

\

Via the online interface, the physical space and a series of events,
Coding the Humanities is going to reach and empower a diverse audience
of people different levels of programming and technological knowledge.
The mix of hands on courses and tutorials and offline workshops will
empower humanities students to enter a dialogue on the impact of digital
tools on their research and ways of collaboration.

\

The collaboration with different institutions and organizations will
increase the diversity of participants and loosen up the homogeneous
group of humanities researchers. The development of services and
products related to humanities research but also aimed at the needs of a
larger public (for example knowledge institutions) ensure that the
dialogue about digital tools exceeds an abstract realm which is not user
centered and evolves between ICT experts. Instead it includes a diverse
groups of a new kind of enabled users.

\

\

**2.2 Measures to maximize impact**

****\

**2.2.1 Dissemination and Exploitation of Results**

\

The project reaches out to a diverse group of humanities students,
researcher and scholars, universities and research institutes, museums,
archives, SMEs of the creative industries sector, civic movements and
especially non-technologically biased people within the general public.

\

The projects seeks to provide models, products and services to enhance
educational training to the indicated group. These impacts shall be
reached following the strategy.

\

\

**Users**

To a large extent, the results of the coding platform will automatically
be available to all.¬† A project manager will be hired and will be
responsible for strategizing and implementing a campaign to disseminate
results. Building the network through the coding platform, as well as
connections to our art network will help to extend this project to
others.¬†

\

How will we increase the (inclusive and innovative) uses and usage of
ICT for:

\

‚Äã1) Research

governmental and heritage collections will be used in new ways in
humanities and social science research when new users with expertise in
their respective disciplines approach them collaboratively, through
programming. Moreover, the platform will foster new inter-disciplinary
collaborations, which further enrich these collections and make them
more accessible and interesting for education.

embedded researchers will explore the possibilities the integration of
online collaboration tools into a living lab

\

‚Äã2) Commercial ends

promoting the platform at developer conferences will draw companies to
the platform to scout for talent, find new ideas for applications and
new solutions to problems, new collaborations with and projects for
institutions

direct involvement of private partners in student projects will advance
the above mentioned processes¬†

\

‚Äã3) Investment

these collaborations between students and researchers will result in
programs that point to the needs of humanities research and the needs of
knowledge institutions to make collections accessible and presentable.
These perspectives can be commercialized and lead to collaborations
between universities and businesses. ¬†

\

‚Äã4) Society

citizens that know how to apply and shape digital tools gain new
insights on policy and decision making processes from open data sets and
provide citizen with political agency

software applications can solve problems of municipalities in a cost
effective and citizen involving way¬† ¬†

\

‚Äã5) policy making

this project provides policy makers with a different way for looking at,
measuring and improving inclusion

\

‚Äã6) education

the "online first" approach we are developing results in new types of
humanities courses that give learners and researchers different
perspectives on their materials of study

\

‚Äã7) labs

the OverLap provides the blueprint for a living lab for on- and offline
collaboration that can be put into practice by various groups and in
various spaces¬†

\

**Exploitation**

\

Apart form the material overarching the project like yearly reports and
best practices, the following materials will be generated and collected
in the three sub-projects:

\

‚Äã1) The platform as Interface

code portfolios from coursework

code portfolios from projects with privat partners

best practice¬†

\

‚Äã2) The Lab as Interface

best practices concerning on- and offline collaborations

reports / evaluations of workshops with students

models / design for living lab furniture interior design

reports on the integration of online platform and offline lab¬† ¬†

\

3 ) Collections as Interfaces

digital artworks (visualizations, videos, animations)¬†

video documentation of creation of artworks¬† ¬†

video documentation of the fare ¬†

visualizations¬†

\

The material generated and collected shall be open for use and reuse.¬†

\

Code and the digital tools resulting from students' work and
collaborations with partners will be stored on different repositories on
github. In order to guarantee the accessiblity and to give the
possibility to re-use the code, it will be stored under the MIT license.
This license will be attached by default to every repository create on
github by its the users. The users will be informed about this procedure
and the license on the platform.

CtH seeks to clone interesting student profiles into one repository
reserved for this purpose in order to create and present an interesting
portfolio.¬†

\

Documents, like evaluations, reports, presentations or conference papers
will be made accessible and stored on github by the different parties of
the consortium under the Creative Commons "share alike" license.

\

Video and audio material will be stored and made accessible under the
same license on the websites of the parties of the consortium who
porduced the content.¬†

\

In order to make guarantee the conservation and accessibility of that
content over a long period of time we are going to use services like
DANS.

\
 The project fundamentally builds on open source and knowledge
strategies that encourages sharing and re-use of code, data and other
materials. We thus follow the maxime that all knowledge generated within
the project should be freely accessible, usable and adaptable.

\

As the consortium follows a non-hierarchical structure as far as
possible, every partner is responsible to make the material and
documents he produces in the realm of the project accessible. The Coding
the Humanities documentation manager controls these processes.

\

\

**2.2.2 Communication Activities**

\

Describe the proposed communication measures for promoting the project
and its findings during the period of the grant. Measures should be
proportionate to the scale of the project, with clear objectives. They
should be tailored to the needs of various audiences, including groups
beyond the project‚Äôs own community. Where relevant, include measures for
public/societal engagement on issues related to the project.

\

**Communication activities**

****\

**Cross-medial process documentation**

****\

**What?**

****\

to display and expose the project through various media and
communication channels using ressources from public-private-partnership¬†

apply creative strategies to the research documentation and medial
communication of larger research projects combining sub-projects into a
larger communication framework, which includes on-/offline best
practices, as this project has a complex structure, uses a variety of
technology, adresses and includes different audiences

to share the knowledge from building the different sub-projects

Serving the overall deliverable to make learnings and models available
in best practices and libraries.

\

**Why?**

\

Science communication is a constituting element of research and learning
in order to bridge the gap between science and society. However, many of
the new medial possiblities, and above all interactive interfaces,
aren't strongly developed yet. The research centers innokom and
Stifterverband conclude in their trend study on science communication,
that the step towards "an open-result-oriented, societally engaged
dialogue is overdue. Drivers behind this development are new formats in
interactive media". Until now, science communication has been
communication by the universities' press office, who pubslished research
results with gate keeper principles. Which means that the results were
communicated further depending on whether or not print, tv or radio
would pick up on it.

\

There can be identified two main reasons for science communication not
reaching beyond an academic public: Either scientists don't have the
necessary skill set in order to act as communicators and media
designers, or the media professionals try to squeeze scientific content
into the standardized storytelling they know from corporate films or TV
reports. The newly emerged field of eLearning and MOOC's possesses great
possibilities for the distribution of knowledge and exchange. However,
there are currently few examples of projects or courses where the
promises of moving images are used to their fullest, and where the
different field of expertise of academic teachers, videographers and
students result in products which reflect their research content in the
best possible way.

\

**How?**

\

The project partners's expertise include both media professionals as
well as researchers. A creative consultant specialised in cross-media
production between research projects, univiersities and media
professionals will coordinate the activities, but also train the
participants through workshops in order to better understand each
other's communication, start making and creating media themselves. The
bridging element of the media and research consultant characterizes yet
again the idea of inclusion and learning, and plays an important role
both for the internal and external media exposure and science
communications activities. Throughout the project, the partners will
attend workshops in order to reflect on the forms of scientific
communication and built best practices for the variety of comunication
activities (see below).

\

built a bridge between the concrete implementation of video, learning
and collecting as one part of the overall platform

cross-medial best practice for science communication; use format of
Scientific Research - trailer as a point-of-departure; produce video
sequences which use filmic language and do justice to the respective
research topic and people who conduct the research

\

**b) Communication activities**

All of the private partners are strong communicators and multipliers in
their respective fields. Each of them will use their regular
communication channels to attract attention and maximize exposure.
Iteration of all of those activities in order to build strong cases
regarding science communication and develop further storytelling
strategies for researchers.

\

The curation of the physical lab includes a variety of communication
activities:

\

every 6 months throughout 3 years: project exhibition of the process

every 3 months throughout 3 years: symposium with workshops and speakers
/ party

monthly: Digital Salon/ Digital Workshop/ Presentations to all Project
partners

Workshops and Pilots

Grand finale in order to end the four year collaborative research
partnership with Dark Horse and mark the moment of complete independency

Science slams / Pecha Kucha's

presenting project results at different types of conferences:
developer-, educational-, heritage-, humanities-oriented (here we need
representation costs).

\

We're reaching commercial companies and various kinds of institutions
by:

\

using kickstarter and crowdfunding to finance and promote the
exhibition. This is also good for societal engagement.

challenging students (a.k.a. researchers or users) to collaborate on
projects with people outside their courses and universities.

The coding sessions workshops: reaches all kinds of new users.

announcing projects and (hackathon) challenges via Europeana. As a
massive European portal for thousands of heritage institutions, such
announcements will reach enormous audiences.

involving other universities in using and developing courses, the
project is promoted in different countries

exhibitions of the Collections sub-project generates massive media
attention and a very broad audience.

\

\

**3. Implementation**

\

3.1 Work plan ‚Äì Work packages, deliverables and milestones

\

*Please provide the following: brief presentation of the overall
structure of the work plan.*

\

The proposed project is structured into three fields:

\

‚Äã1) The Platform as Interface: In this work package an online platform
for learning and research will be conceptualized by offering programming
training to humanities students. It will serve as a forum for a wider
user group and will engender fruitful collaborations in learning new
technologies.

\

‚Äã2) The Lab as Interface is to be an offline space that complements the
online platform and provides an in-between environment for university
partners, in addition to public and private partners to connect and pool
their skills and perspectives towards innovations.

\

‚Äã3) The Collection as Interface will be an exploration of the inclusive
opportunities interfaces and visualization of data holds for knowledge
production.

\

These three fields will be developed simultaneously, with an emphasis in
the early stages on building the platform.

\

Inspired by open source culture and software development practices the
fields are going to be explored simulataneously so that insights from
one of the fields can be applied tranfered early on to the other fields.

**Table¬† 3.1 a: Work package description¬†**

Collections as interfaces: The exhibition would be a combination of on
and offline projects, culminating in a public six week exhibitio in
Vienna three years into the project. We endeavor to involve students
from the platform, partners from the lab space, as well as other private
and public partners, developers, and the general population. This
exhibition would consist of workshops, data events, speakers, art
installations, and presentations on relationships between ITC, art,
business, and cultural heritage.

| Their user centered approach and the background in anthropology and      |
| interior design allows Lisa Zoth and Patrick Kenzler to understand and   |
| translate the requirements of such a space into a practical design       |
| concept and the according user culture. They will provide an answer to   |
| the crucial question of how online collaboration and innovative practice |
| can be initiated, accelerated and fostered through an offline setting.   |
| Moreover their research will provide insights to the students‚Äô needs     |
| that cannot be satisfied merely by the application of ICT but are better |
| addressed with a combination of digital instruments and offline          |
| collaboration and training methods.                                      |

|                                                                          |
| First and foremost this is due to the interfacing options offered as     |
| dialog systems on top of these¬†                                          |
|                                                                          |
| datasets. They focus mainly on retrieval and object by object            |
| examination. They offer retrieval for which the user needs to know what  |
| he or she wants to retrieve. A move towards interfaces that are more     |
| discovery oriented is desirable. These discovery environments would      |
| offer the user a way to look at the body of data as a whole in a visual  |
| way and while examining the data in such a way find what there is to     |
| discovery, this might well lead to a classic retrieval scenarios but one |
| in which the user has been able to educate him or herself about the data |
| with little to no upfront knowledge. That would result in greater        |
| inclusion with regard to all potential users of such datasets.¬†          |

| We propose a system that includes a visualization and interface layer    |
| that is exposed to the user via web browser. This vis/ux layer will be   |
| fed by the dataset directly and by an engine performing the necessary    |
| operations to do such things as item matching (image or text             |
| similarity). Thirdly we would want to open up these capabilities not     |
| only through our vis/ux layer but also by means of an API so others can  |
| build their own vis/ux layers and for instance build mobile              |
| applications.¬†                                                           |

**3.2 Management structure and procedures**

*Describe the organisational structure and the decision-making
(including a list of milestones (table 3.2a));*

The management structure of the platform will be distributed rather than
centralized, aligning with our mechanisms from open source development
and Github. Github is an excellent platform to collect ideas and share
feedback, allowing for open discussion and a well informed decision
making process. Additional sources of inspiration include contemporary
project management methods such as agile and scrum. We will have Pull
Requests for bug and problem fixes and new features, Forks and Clones of
the platform and the course curricula, and maintainers who are
responsible for individual aspects of the project. The platform will be
used to facilitate its own management.

\

To get regular feedback, we will have an international advisory board
with members from different universities, as well as private partners
and civic organisations. The board will meet approximately once per
year. We will also have a student board with students from courses,
locally, with the goal of extending the board internationally. The
student board will meet twice per semester to evaluate the on and
offline aspects of the platform.

\

**Table 3.2a List of Milestones**

\

+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+
| **Milestone**                        | **Date**                             |

+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+

\

\

*Explain why the organisational structure and decision-making mechanisms
are appropriate to the complexity and scale of the project;*

\

The meetings every two months with the student board are appropriate
because the platform will be constantly developing; discussing changes
will be essential to organizing plans and making decisions. The annual
meetings with the international advisory board is appropriate because
the board must also convene to make larger decisions.

\

*Describe, where relevant, how effective innovation management will be
addressed in the management structure and work plan;¬†*

**\

Effective innovation management is central to the way of working in the
lab as interface field of this project. Linking humanities students to
the business world will steer innovation towards products that are
marketable, original, as well as appropriate.

\

Innovation management is a process which requires an understanding of
both market and technical problems, with a goal of successfully
implementing appropriate creative ideas. A new or improved product,
service or process is its typical output. It also allows a consortium to
respond to an external or internal opportunity.

\

*Describe any critical risks, relating to project implementation, that
the stated project‚Äôs objectives may not be achieved. Detail any risk
mitigation measures. Please provide a table with critical risks
identified and mitigating actions (table 3.2b).*

\

**3.3 Consortium as a whole**

\

The consortium for the proposed project consists of the public
institutions University of Amsterdam (NL), Europeana (NL) and The
National Museum of World Cultures (NL) complemented by the private
partners CastYourArt (AT), The Dark Horse (D) and Weyeser (NL).

\

The constellation allows the consortium to look at and discuss the role
of ICT in education and teaching from various perspectives. Each partner
adds another expertise to the project that enables to develop the
concrete online platform, the offline lab and the test case of a
concrete applicable tools. At the same time is every partner is feeding
into the dialog and debate with students, researchers and scholars about
that the possibilities and limitations of ICT related knowledge
production. This input is thus informed by their experience from former
projects but also derives from the concrete development of solutions for
ICT applications within the framework of the project.

\

The University of Amsterdam will bring in the insights gained during the
three above mentioned coding related seminars with students conducted in
2013/2014 to conceptualize the needs of humanities students for the
development of the platform. Further information for the development of
the different platform components will be introduced by the design
thinking company The Dark Horse with its experience in the conceptions
of online interface. Together with one software developer members of the
UvA are going develop the platform itself and benefit form the knowledge
about visualization strategies brought into the project by the dutch
company weyeser.

\

In a series of workshops The Dark Horse will apply their user focused
strategies to analyze the needs of students and researchers concerning
an offline lab that can stimulate and enhance the use of ICT based
learning processes and collaborations. The Dark Horse is experienced in
the conception and design of spaces that are situated between on- and
offline word. They will be committed to the actual design of a lab in
Amsterdam of which serves as a blueprint in terms of design and
collaborative working practices for similar labs.

\

The two interfaces described above form the working basis for the actual
development of coding projects that feed from the expertise, encountered
audience related challenges and data sets of the Europeana network. The
challenges pointed out by Europeana representatives in a series of
workshops will be discussed and approach by students and researchers of
the UvA. CastYourArt and weyeser will initiate discussions and projects
with the students that will produce software solutions that interface
digitized cultural heritage with an potential audience.

\

A series of events that follow up events initiated by the UvA in
2013/2014 ("datadrive", "codingsessions") will be organized together
with the private partners in form of workshops, hackathon and
presentations and ensure that the produced outcome of the student
projects and the knowledge generated by the partners involved is made
known to a bigger audience. The project the students projects will
finally be presented in an exhibition in Vienna. This exhibition will be
organized, curated and documented by CastYourArt.

\

The UvA trains the students, The Dark Horse develops models form the
experience of the students for the online and offline platform and the
interrelation of the two. Europeana provides challenges and data-sets
for the students projects. weyeser supports the students in their
projects and co-develops the online platform with the UvA. CastYourArt
also supports the students in their projects, organizes, curates and
documents the exhibition.

\

The National Museum of World Cultures operates in the Netherlands and
has both‚Äã a physical and a digital collection. They have a strong focus
on ethnography and therefore on the colonial past of the Netherlands in
particular, which inherently deals with hiearchies and distribution of
knowledge. Their projects connect the digitized collections with on-site
exhibitions and crowd-sourced information retrieval. Therefore as
opposed to Europeanan, where the focus lies on providing accessibility
to digital heritage, the newly formed museum will function as testing
grounds for the student project. It offers the researchers and students
in Amsterdam to interact with both their physical and digital collection
and therefore to set up projects which are locally and globally situated
in between rather than just deriving data sets.

\

All of the achieved insights are documented in form of presentations,
evaluations forms, reports, video and code on an open online repository
accessible through the online learning platform.
