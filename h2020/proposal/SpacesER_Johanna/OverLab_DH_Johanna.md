###  Project Overview

> Thus, when we think of the factory of the future we should rather think of it as scientific laboratoria, art academies and libraries and discotheques instead of our contemporary factories. And the apparatushuman (Apparatmenschen) of the future we have to imagine as an academic rather than a craftsmen, worker or engineer. *Flusser 2002b: 170*

>However, because these entities represent exceptions to the principle of organizing our research programs within regular academic channels, they may create unique challenges that must be addressed in order for them to succeed.
*Establishing and Managing Independent Laboratories, Institutes and Centers*

Embedded researcher is a new and exiting role within the university. Its goal is to establish sustainable partnerships between private partners and universities. In practice, however, this turns out to be problematic, since the role and position of this kind of researcher is peripheral by definition. The embedded research usual works on short term projects and inbetween the academy and a company which seeks to establish sustainable collaborations between the creative industries and universities.
Though the future of research lies more and more in collaborations between disciplines and fields, between public and private partnerships, practice and theory, between classic methodology and flexible theory, co-creation and collaborations the interdisciplinary researcher enters work spaces which are not built by or for them and uses methodology and means of exposure which remain in the respective fields. 

Where artists use their atelier, designers their studio and scientists their lab for experimentation, testing and collaboration, the embedded researcher enters a traditional, disciplinary university environment even though they are often expected to address research questions with a practical and creative research aspect. But artistic expression and creativity do not obey closing hours and bureaucratic sterility of university buildings.

A virtual and physical lab is essential to compensate for the abovementioned problems. An online and offline platform - that already exists before they start, and will start after their contracts end - a space is a necessary precondition for Embedded Research projects that are actually sustainable. In this project we want to explore how such a lab should look like.

Therefore this project seeks to investigate and built upon the combined needs for newly established forms of researchs by means of self-reflective research by the combined skills and expertise of the public and private partner using design thinking. 
When working from a human-centered approach it is crucial to not think of the form of the outcome right away or to be limited to just one medium or technology. But in order to experiment and innovate, a flexible workspace is as much needed as a flexible methodological framework which stimulates creating research designs with specific tools. 



Need
- increasing need of knowledge workers to combine theoretical as well as hands-on approaches in their research
- current workspaces do not provide enough space, the right material and technology to experiment
- methodological framework for researching interdisciplinary methodology
- best practice for building sustainable public-private-partnerships


###   Introduction
The importance of user-centricity is a central topic across (scientific) disciplines such as product design, business and marketing studies. The recent avowal that users drive innovation in the time of wikinomics, crowdsourcing and social networking seems to have sparked this interest further, leading to both utopian and dystopian views about what consumers can contribute to innovation practices. At times, access to ICTs is equated with increased democracy, as well as with both social and business innovation. Democratizing design practices would offer technology users even more power to make “a difference” while at the same time providing a way for technology producers to make a product more successful on the market. After all, doesn’t involving the expected future users in the design process of a new ICT product stimulate the creation of a market for said product? At the same time, critical questions are asked about the “revolution” offered by online (web 2.0) technologies. Scholars question the extent to which “the digital revolution” should be equated with a social revolution and call for critical awareness of the socioeconomic implications of trends such as “co-creation” (Van Dijck & Nieborg, 2009); what interests are at play in these practices and how can these be deconstructed?

One approach to realize co-creation practices, specifically between public-private-civic partners, is the so-called Living Lab-approach. Living Labs situate ICT development practices in daily life settings to gain insights about unexpected uses of technologies. ICT users, in turn, are not only primarily included in their role of “user”, but also in guises mostly associated with those involved in the design and development process of ICTs. Coupled, the unexpected knowledge ascertained by changing the site of and the people “in” the laboratory is ultimately to lead to the development of more successful innovative ICT products and services. By transforming mundane environments into experimentation areas, interactions – in this case between users and technologies-in-the-making in this environment - become the subject of enquiry for Living Laboratories. “The unexpected” is expected to be found by investigating user-technology interactions. Living Labs can thus be said to adhere to a promise that is not unlike a tagline of a generic blockbuster film, namely to “expect the unexpected”.

But how is the uncovering of the unexpected achieved such co-creative (e)laboratories? Previous insights in the discovery of knowledge in scientific laboratories show how in these controlled environments messy relationships and processes become stabilised and “purified” into “a textual account of nature, and a set of more of less formulaic statements about method” (Law, 2007: 4). Facts are shown to be constructed; Science and Technology Studies scholars such as Latour and Woolgar (1979) trace how sociomaterial interactions in the laboratory become stabilised in accepted facts. Attempting to find unexpected insights in environments that are expressly less controlled and situated in “the living”, suggests that these labs actively seek out open and messy sociomaterial practices in order to find a kind of knowledge “in the wild” (Hutchins, 1995).

While the research area of Living Labs and public-private-civic partnerships is still in its early development, research into open innovation practices in labs that are formed out of public-private-civic partnerships show certain trends pertaining to the inclusion of end users in open innovation practices. For example while these labs may seek to democratize design and development of new ICT products and services, the end user as such is more often than not mainly included as part of the user-centric methodology, not as part of the partnership consortium. This has implications; whereas the promise of democratization and of uncovering unexpected and innovative ideas and practices of end users, locking “the user” into their role of “user” seems to preclude precisely the treatment of this user as an “equal”, providing input during development directly. Users are characterized, for example, as in need of motivation to join in on laboratory activities.

Innovation practices are not easily dividable in clear-cut categories of top down or bottom-up innovation. For example, Daft (1978) observes both processes of top down and bottom-up innovation in organizational innovation. In the same vein, Enkel and colleagues (Enkel, Gassmann, & Chesbrough, 2009) articulate the importance of different flows of knowledge to help establish (open) innovation: outside-in processes, inside-out processes and coupled processes, the latter of which is specifically connected to practices of co-creation. Chesbrough argues that in order to cope with the uncertain success of innovations, companies should open up their innovation processes. Likening the hitherto “traditional” innovation processes of firms to a game of chess, he proposes that in practicing open innovation, companies should instead focus on developing a process for playing poker. This means accepting that successful innovation is very much uncertain and dependent on uncontrollable contextual (in this case market) conditions (Chesbrough, 2004: 25). Be it chess or poker, games start with people who are willing to play. In Living Laboratories, prospective technology users are invited to join the game of open innovation. At the same time, these users are part of the gameplay itself; their inclusion is part of the rulebook. Their actions, ideas and contributions may well be, coupled with the fact that Living Lab-practices are set in a daily life setting, “the uncertain” elements that characterise open innovation in Living Labs. Still, their inclusion is regarded with some ambivalence exactly because of the uncertain outcomes. It is not clear in advance what their contributions will bring to the innovation process.









Challenge

The work space of the embedded researchers are regular office spaces at the university, supplied with a desk and a computer. The scope of most projects however require a variety of work settings.
When working from a human-centered approach it is crucial to not think of the form of the outcome right away or to be limited to just one medium or technology. But in order to experiment and innovate, a flexible workspace is needed. Artistic expression and creativity do not obey closing hours and bureaucratic sterility of university buildings.

How could the ideal workspace for knowledge workers within the faculty of the humanities at the UvA look like? How could the working environment be adapted to meet the changed research requirements of knowledge workers at the Departments for Digital Humanities, Media Studies, Cultural Analysis and Artistic Research?
How can these physical structures create a sustainable link with an online learning environment? And how can the analogue and digital workspaces best be linked to each other?

### 3.2 Management structure and procedures 

#####*Describe any critical risks, relating to project implementation, that the stated project’s objectives may not be achieved. Detail any risk mitigation measures. Please provide a table with critical risks identified and mitigating actions (table 3.2b).*

critical questions to be answered in the proposal:

- How can embedded research projects most effectively be realized when conducted and managed outside of existing organizational units? 



- What is the likelihood of long-term and active participation in the OverLab structure by faculty and (graduate) students? 

Future University related research has to be informed by open methodologies. Increasingly funding is spread competitively for small research periods, also in order to foster the collaboration between the public and the private sector, for example in the form of embedded researchers. Even though the emphasis here is on sustainable research, the projects are often closed and presented and not open for further development (unless some additional funding allows to proceed) 
Truely sustainable research is OPEN and would mean that a project has releases - at some point (after the official end of the research period) other students, embedded researchers are allowed and encouraged to take the outcome of the research, alter and develop it further. At some point (after the official end of the research period) other students, embedded researchers are allowed and encouraged to take the outcome of the research, alter and develop it further.

- What impact (positive or negative) will the OverLab have on the participating faculties' home academic department? 
The impact of OverLab and OverTools on the participating faculties will depend strongly on the attitude towards new forms of research. The potential of the research and learning environment has 

- What resources will be required to support the unit, and how will those resources be obtained and managed? 

- To what extent will establishment of the new entity help to attract external support? 

*Questions adjusted from “Rationale and Impact” for Establishing and Managing Independent Laboratories, Institutes and Centers at the Stanford University.* 


#####*Describe, where relevant, how effective innovation management will be addressed  in the management structure and work plan; Innovation management is a process which requires an understanding of both market and technical problems, with a goal of successfully implementing appropriate creative ideas. A new or improved product, service or process is its typical output. It also allows a consortium to respond to an external or internal opportunity.*

**Dark Horse** is an innovation agency based in Berlin which creates user-centered products and services and helps clients to change their structures, processes and minds. Their work is based on Design Thinking principles and their own unusual working culture that simultaneously stresses ﬂexibility and connections. They design spatial, procedural and social conditions of collaboration in on- and offline settings. Guided by their participative design approach, they created spaces and working culture for collaboration in science and creative industry.

Within the proposed project Dark Horse is going to conduct research on and develop a conceptual framework and design for a physical space that accompanies and complements the online learning platform. Their user centered approach and the background in anthropology and interior design allows Lisa Zoth and Patrick Kenzler to understand and translate the requirements of such a space into a practical design concept and the according user culture. They will provide an answer to the crucial question of how online collaboration and innovative practice can be initiated, accelerated and fostered through an offline setting. Moreover their research will provide insights to the students’ needs that cannot be satisfied merely by the application of ICT but are better addressed with a combination of digital instruments and offline collaboration and training methods.

**Lisa Zoth** has a background in political science and anthropology. She has conducted several projects in regard to the implementation of the Design Thinking Methodology and Culture into companies such as SAP or Deutsche Bahn. Her research focus lies on the design of organizational collaboration and implementing innovation processes into traditional structures. Lisa Zoth will in this project be mainly involved in the need finding, synthesis and ideation phase of the project and evaluating the collaboration processes among the embedded researchers. 

**Patrick Kenzler** is an architect and interior designer. In his research he focusses on the design of spatial concepts for collaboration. Patrick Kenzler has conceptualized and designed several collaboration spaces such as for the HPI School of Design Thinking or the Humboldt Lab. In this project he will be involved in the needfinding, synthesis and ideation phase and is mainly responsible for the 3D-modeling of the first prototype as well as the furnishing and the fitting-out of the Living Lab.

#### A list of up to 5 relevant previous projects or activities, connected to the subject of this proposal 
**Note that there are pictures visualising the projects and tools used available**

1. Lufthansa Technik AG: Spaces for collaboration
Lufthansa Technik AG asked Dark Horse to research the existing working culture at Lufthansa Technik and to develop a spatial concept for collaboration based on these findings.
Through observation, interviews and participatory workshops all 400 employees were involved in the analysis and conceptual phase. The main focus lied in identifying the opportunities for change whilst preserving other spatial concepts and processes that already worked well in the existing structure.
Due to the research findings and developed concepts Dark Horse will be further involved in the planning of two new office floors. The interior design of these spaces will offer spatial qualities that enable the collaboration among the employees while at the same time giving space and infrastructure for individual work.
Dark Horse will undertake a moderating and consulting role towards the employees in enabling them to use the new spaces and implementing a successful working culture.

2. Deutsche Bahn AG: Moving Ideas
Deutsche Bahn AG is one of the largest transport companies in the world. All suppliers and industrial partners form part of a huge network. The idea was to benefit from this hub of expertise and to turn it into a driver for innovation. Dark Horse got engaged to develop a virtual platform that facilitates the collaboration across all branches.
Dark Horse developed a browser based platform on which projects can be launched, discussed and worked on. The platform offers users the possibility to get instant and multi-perspective feedback on the current stages of their project. In addition to that the platform serves as the link between the digital and analog world of each project.

3. Out of the Box: Whiteboard
Working mainly in a physical space with post-it notes and whiteboards Dark Horse itself is in need for specific creativity tools. While existing whiteboards lacked flexibility and usability Dark Horse together with Room in a Box, a company specialized on cardboard furniture, developed a lightweight and user-friendly whiteboard. 
The board is built out of cardboard and is supplied with four movable disks. By analogy to the first digital data discs, these discs are writeable from both sides and serve as a digital store that can be carried around and taken to the next meeting.

4. SAP AG: Design Thinking & Scrum for innovative projects
In 2012 the SAP AG started the initiative to implement the Design Thinking Methodology in their company. Dark Horse accompanied SAP Germany and SAP India for more than a year in applying the Design Thinking Methodology to the product development and to create innovative products. Different Scrum-Teams got trained and consulted by Dark Horse in Design Thinking and user-centered design throughout the conceptual and designing phase of their products. The awareness for the users’ need and the implementation of collaborative elements had a noticeable impact on the „innovativeness“ of the products.

5. Audi AG: Ideas Virus
The Audi AG hired Dark Horse in order to find out about existing innovation hubs within their company. Through interviews and observation Dark Horse identified persons and departments that are key to the innovation processes and product development at Audi. Based on these findings the Audi AG launched a process that aims at designing a concept for collaboration among the employees and thus foster innovation.
