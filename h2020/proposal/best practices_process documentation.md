Overall Deliverable: Make learnings and models available in best practices and libraries.


### Towards a format of cross-medial process documentation 

what? 

- 
- develop further the process documentation and medial communication of larger research projects
- display and exposure of the project 

how?

- cross-medial best practice 
- built a bridge between the concrete implementation of video, learning and collecting as one part 
of the overall platform
- use format of Scientific Research Trailer as a point-of-departure
- research which media can be used for science communication in which way


why? reasons for this approach

- this project has a complex structure, uses a variety of technology, adresses and includes different audiences
- to share the knowledge from building the different sub-projects 
- the newly emerged field of eLearning and MOOC's possesses great possibilities for the distribution of knowledge and exchange. However, there are currently few examples of projects or courses where the promises of moving images are used to their fullest, and where the different field of expertise of academic teachers, videographers and students result in products which reflect their research content in the best possible way.

Science communication is a constituting element of research and learning in order to bridge the gap between science and society. However, many of the new medial possiblities, and above all interactive interfaces, aren't strongly developed yet. The research centers *innokom* and *Stifterverband* conclude in their trend study on science communication, that the step towards "an open-result-oriented, societally engaged dialogue is overdue. Drivers behind this development are new formats in interactive media." Until now, science communication has been communication by the universities' press office, who pubslished research results with gate keeper principles. Which means that the results were communicated further depending on whether or not print, tv or radio would pick up on it. 

There can be identified two main reasons for science communication not reaching beyond an academic public: Either scientists don't have the necessary skill set in order to act as communicators and media designers, or the media professionals try to squeeze scientific content into the standardized storytelling they know from corporate films or TV reports.

who? 

Johanna Barnbeck investigates the format of Scientific Research Trailer as a way to adequately communicate research practices to relevant audiences. Together with universities and research institutes she produces video sequences which use filmic language and do justice to the respective research topic and people who conduct the research. 

The Research Trailers are embedded in conference talks in order to give context information, serve as a
