### 1. Excellence 

*Your proposal must address a topic set out in the work programme, for this call for proposals. This section of your proposal will be assessed only to the extent that it is relevant to that topic.*


#### 1.1 Objectives 
*Describe the specific objectives for the project, which should be clear, measurable, realistic and achievable within the duration of the project. Objectives should be consistent with the expected exploitation and impact of the project (see section 2).* 

<!-- What is the problem? -->

Learning and research (in the Humanities) are hindered by a lack of coding skills and the seeming incommensurability of educating massive groups of students and providing high quality education.


<!-- Why is it an interesting/important problem? -->

Although traditional knowledge institutions are losing their monopoly on education and research, ICT skills and knowledge production remain privileges of a cultural, technological and economic elite.


<!-- What is our solution to this problem? -->
We propose to tackle this problem by providing online and offline interfaces between people on the one hand and learning and research on the other hand, which focus on new forms of collaboration and a user- and tool-oriented approach to learning programming skills.


<!-- What are the consequences of our solution? -->
These interfaces lower the technological, economic and organizational barriers to participation, empower many different groups of people to more deeply and effectively engage with technology and motivate lifelong learning.


We identify four dilemmas about statements on learning and research that can be challenged or embraced:

1. *Digital Literacy*: Education and research (in the Humanities) increasingly depend on people with programming skills.
2. *Organization*: Traditional knowledge institutions are losing their monopoly on education and research.
3. *Numbers*: Future education should revolve around massive numbers (Big Data, MOOC).
4. *Elite*: Coding and knowledge production remain privileges of a cultural, technological and economic elite.

Our answer to these dilemmas provide the following objectives:

1. Digital Literacy: Increase the number of people who approach learning and research collaboratively, through an online platform where users collaboratively learn programming and build tools, thereby increasing digital literacy and at same time lowering the technological threshold to engage with and reflect on digital tools. (challenge and embrace)

2. Organization: Create interfaces for users to teach each other and learn and research collaboratively, out of their own motivation, but use institutional structures to kick-start this process and provide disciplinary contexts. (challenge and embrace)

3. Numbers: Increase the number of people learning and researching by focusing on collaboration and sharing knowledge, so that individual approaches and feedback remain possible, thereby retaining high quality education. (challenge and embrace)

4. Elite: Make learning and research accessible and relevant by offering interfaces that allow many different types of users to learn to use and do research with technology  (challenge)

These objectives present learning and inclusion as problems of interfaces. By definition, interfaces determine who or what is included and excluded. The focus of this project is thus on providing interfaces that increase inclusion, where users build, explore and reflect on digital tools and how we use them. The overarching goal is to weave technology and humanities together to foster innovation through three forums: an expandable platform for humanities students collaborate through coding, a lab space where humanities thinking influences product and business design, and an exhibition which engages technology, art, business, and humanities. <!-- We aim to elevate the processes of tool building to the status of research in the humanities. -->
We propose to do this in three parts:

1. *Platform as interface*: an expandable platform for humanities students to collaboratively learn programming and build tools for their research. The coding platform would develop new courses with both on and offline components. Our goal is to introduce four new courses of 12 ETCs, one each year. The new courses would enable Coding the Humanities to expand students’ introduction to programming to an open space where they would collaborate with people from all over the world in their ICT engagement. It would foster communication among students and other participants by serving as a space where they can share and experiment with findings, improvise together, and enjoy the thrill of new learning with a network of support. The goal in terms of inclusion would be to reach 20,000 users in four years. The University of Amsterdam would begin by including four other universities in this platform, linking the students through the coursework. The University of California Santa Barbara, University of California Irvine, and Humboldt University of Berlin are highly motivated to take part in this platform. 

2. *Lab as interface*: The lab space would be an offline physical space in Amsterdam where students could work together with private partners to create new products and services that involve humanities thinking; applying a humanities perspective to practical applications outside academia. Our goal is to create one new product or service per year that meets a need within the humanities, and one new product or service per year that meets a need for a more general or different audience.

3. *Collections as interfaces*: The exhibition would be a combination of on and offline projects, culminating in a public six week exhibition in the Museum Square in Vienna three years into the project. We endeavor to involve students from the platform, partners from the lab space, as well as other private and public partners, developers, and the general population. This exhibition would consist of workshops, data events, speakers, art installations, and presentations on relationships between ITC, art, business, and cultural heritage.

We also challenge the traditional educational dichotomy of researchers as experts and students as novices. Learning and research are hard to separate as both revolve around involve producing and sharing knowledge, where each participant can be both the sender and receiver of knowledge. This leads us to five principles which will guide our implementation of these interfaces:

1. *Training over support*: Our first core value is training so that a learner will soon be able to pass on the knowledge to another learner. While support can result in repeatedly assisting the same person with the same issue, maintaining a distinction and even hierarchy in skillsets, training provides experience to the learner to bring them to an equal level to the trainer.
2. *Collaboration over ownership*: Related to training over support is our second core principle, which favors collaborative over competitive efforts. Owning processes and results together on an equal basis promotes great teamwork.
3. *Online over Massive*: The format of the platform encourages students to first learn coding online, but intends them to also have a physical team within their institution. This complements the Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) concept, which includes only an online context for learning.
4. *Knowledge production over data processing*: <explanation>
5. *Accessibility over state-of-the-art*: Our fifth core value is that of tools that are less complicated to begin to use over those that are state-of-the-art. Whereas state-of-the-art tools attract primarily the technically biased, more accessible tools have the power to reach a wider group of new users, including the non-technically biased. This supports our goal of inclusion of traditionally and currently underrepresented populations in ICT.

Coding the Humanities is already a strong and unique research project in Amsterdam (UvA, VU, HvA) that has been successfully running for over one year. Closely linked to projects such as zooniverse, dh, data drive, AAA, chat, and circa, Coding the Humanities explores interplay between humanities and technology. We engage traditionally non-technically biased students with technology in order to empower them to proactively create their own tools, as well as to more deeply and holistically reflect on those tools. We aim to extend beyond the coursework currently offered in order to connect humanities students to artistic, cultural, and business institutions. 

To enrich these courses and enhance the analysis of the coding platform's processes and results, we seek funding from other sources to offer two PhD positions related to relationships between humanities and technology. These positions would be excellent additions to the project, whose primary focus is to create new products and services and support research and development activities. Each project will address a key aspect of the overall objective to foster connections between technology and humanities.

The first project will address the Physical Lab element, and will involve a PhD student working part-time as an embedded researcher in a separate institution. The project will investigate sustainable forms of knowledge transfer and creative and collaborative work practices in combined digital and physical learning environments.

The second project would relate to the core project of the coding platform. The PhD student would research how to reflect on tools through coding. S/he would conceptualize, plan, monitor, and program the coding platform. This PhD would serve as a way of measuing the development and success of the platform over four years. This researcher will be well integrated into the context of the university's department of digital humanities, and will also collaborate with private and public partners.


#### 1.2 Relation to the Work Programme

*Indicate the work programme topic to which your proposal relates, and explain how your proposal addresses the specific challenge and scope of that topic, as set out in the work programme.* 


The project proposed fits the work programm "Platform for ICT for Learning and Inclusion" as it seeks to initiate a dialogue between university scholars and students, artists, knowledge institutions and private companies about the potential merits of ICT for new forms of teaching, learning, knowledge production and transfer.  

The dialogue will be initiated on and around a open online learning and collaboration platform that allows students, researchers but also the general public in an hands on approach to shape ICT and discuss ICT related issues. The platform seeks to train students and researchers to understand and shape the digital tools surrounding them. The open design of this interface encourages them to pass on the tools they created and the knowledge they generated.   

The exchange on the use of and knowledge about ICT in research and education will be further advanced by an offline lab that accompanies the online platform. In this space, that explores the interplay of on- and offline collaborations, workshops, hackathons and presentations are set up to point the attention of a broad audience towards ICT as a means to enhance knowledge production and encourage them to participate on the online platform itself. 

Finally the software projects, insights of students, private and public partners will feed into a 6 week exhibition in Vienna on the engagement of ICT and knowledge production addressing a large audience and engaging them in workshops. The documentation of the exihibition will be openly accessible online. 

Thus this project aims at providing a platform that equips its users with agency concerning the application of ICT for knowledge production, in order to increase the overall amount of people that can join ICT related discussions. 

The members of the consortium combine a broad expertise that allows to explore how ICT can enhance humanities research and education, how these insights can help knowledge institutions to make their heritage more accessible and understandable for a larger public and how these knowledge can inspire SMEs for the development of new products and services.

The consortium will provide training and consultation to humanities students, researchers and scholars. It will generate models and strategies concerning the use and development of ICT for teaching and education in an online and offline context that are valuable to other universities, public institutions and companies. 

In order to involve a large number of students, researcher, scholars but also non-technology biased people in general terms, the platform reaches out to other universities, knowledge institutions and private partners alike in order to initiate a dialogue about new forms of education that not only integrates ICT but empowers a large number of people to use and shape these technologies to their specific needs. Due to the open licenses used the digital tools developed by the students can be applied and altered also by social institutions, civic movements or the general public.  



#### 1.3 Concept and approach, quality of the coordination and support measures

*Describe and explain the overall concept underpinning the project. Describe the main ideas, models or assumptions involved;* 
Connecting humanities to technology unlocks potential for holistic approaches to innovation, including those that consider ethical/moral impacts of technology and its use, ...


##### 1.3.1 Introduction

Many humanities students and scholars are reluctant to learn new technologies, and thereby limit both their own ability to influence the outside world, as well as the incorporation of technology in their research. As Mitch Resnick has said, not being able to take charge of the technological tools we use to meet our own particular needs is similar to being able only to read a language but not write. For full use of the language and to use it to express ourselves, we must also be able to use it to create new structures. To make full use of technologies, we must be able not just to use them passively, but to modify them. This venture will empower humanities students and scholars to proactively drive their own learning and research. When they engage with technology through coding, they open the doors to master and innovate their own tools.


The coding platform will build upon Coding the Humanities, an already strong research project at the University of Amsterdam that has been successfully running for more than a year. Coding the Humanities is closely linked to several other projects, including zooniverse, dh, chat, and circa, and explores interplay between humanities and technology within the humanities faculty. It currently introduces programming to humanities students through coursework. We have three courses that are incorporated into the curriculum on programming basics. The course "Art, Science, and Technology" is running now, and the courses "Coding the Humanities" and "From Objected Data" will both begin in September 2014. Increasing the number of humanities students and scholars with programming skills through this coding platform will allow them to shape and create digital tools that meet their particular research needs and encourage new forms of learning, teaching and knowledge production. This skillset will sensitize the participants to their technological environment and make them aware of the challenges and opportunities ICT offers for humanities research. Coding knowledge makes those in the humanities more employable because humanities students and scholars will increasingly need to be able to read and write code. Expanding the context beyond the classroom to the coding platform will give students a venue to connect and share with participants outside the university.


##### 1.3.2 Assumptions involved


- assumption that academia and the rest of the world are separate and cannot interact, and the idea that they can work together. More specifically, the idea that humanities students and scholars are separated from technology, and the goal of engaging them with it.

- universities face a loss of authority as models of traditional education being replicated in online formats, and the goal of creating new tools in the context of today’s increasingly interdependent world

- transfering the classroom into online formats does no justice to the possibilities provided by online tools in terms of peer learning, collaboration, exchange that abandons the dichotomy of experts and layman

- We thus work from a model that favors collaboration over ownership. Rather than competing against one another, we seek to create environments and promote tools that encourage equality in teamwork.

- Our model favors training rather than support, with the perspective that empowering people to take charge of the tools they use is better than simply assisting them. Also related to the goal of increasing the number of people who know how their tools function, our model emphasises accessible tools over state of the art tools. Accessibility is condusive to a wider group of users and makers, while state of the art tools discourage those who do not consider themselves to be tech-savy.

- We also favor knowledge production over data processing...

##### 1.3.3 Structure

This research proposal consists of three integrated action fields in which public-private-civic partnerships (quad-helix) lead to a sharing of expertise and collaborative practices geared at the development of a cutting-edge innovative educational ecosystem that is specific to the (digital) humanities but reaches beyond this realm. These fields are socio-technical in their approach; apart from combining insights from different partners to develop technological solutions (such as an online educational platform), valorize existing and new R&D methodologies (such as design thinking methodologies and embedded research practices) and the translation of data streams and information in intuitive interfaces that make use of visualization, this research proposal seeks to specially gear technological developments and efforts to enhance society by closing the digital divide. By collaborating throughout the project with public, private and civic partners, the project foresees the accumulation of knowledge and a digital skilling of particular hitherto unreached civic groups. 

These efforts should be viewed in line with two overarching developments in contemporary society and in humanities’ research; the move to create smart cities where citizens are digitally empowered and the development of digital humanities. By integrating the digital skilling of citizens with the agenda of the development of digital humanities, the project aims to perform academic research through a digital inclusion methodology/practice. Practically, the envisioned educational platform realizes local engagement, user-focused learning with both an individually-oriented as well as collective component; collaboration and the accumulation of knowledge and skills are key to a successful implementation of the platform.

Each of the three areas anticipates and addresses an upcoming challenge. 

###### 1.3.3.1 The Platform as Interface 

In order to initiate a fruitful debate about the development and application of ICT it is crucial not only to start that debate among ICT experts. On the contrary, this debate should evolve around users and their needs. Thus one of the main challenges to face for the creation of a sustainable dialogue about the opportunities ICT offers is to interest and educate non-technologically biased persons in the use and development of ICT.  

CtH pursues this goal by addressing humanities students and at the same time provides an online learning interface that is reaching out to non-technologically biased people in general by lowering the threshold to engage with ICT. This platform therefore opens up the closed university realm for the education up to bigger numbers and overcomes the limitation of ICT training to a cultural, technological and economical elite.   

Whereas classical digital humanities programs often rely ICT experts that develop programs for the humanities and provide for supportive actions for the implementation of these tools, coding the humanities seeks to train the students and researchers themselves to shape ICT and understand the possibilities the tools they hold in their hands offer. Hereby the online platform intends to enlarge the circle of people that are involved in the development of ICT beyond the small group of experts. 

The platform provides an "online first" approach which means that the students find the means to learn coding and work collaboratively online first through courses and tutorials but can complement these tools with offline meetings. This approach avoids the mere transfer of offline teaching methods into the online world, which is a typical weakness of many Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), but explores what offline collaboration can be informed by strategies applied with online tools and how innovative offline practices can initiate and foster online cooperation. It seeks to provide students with the technological foundations to acquire and develop these skills by themselves and in peer learning based processes, based on tutorials and assignments

CtH projects are produced and stored under open licenses which encourages the collaboration and reuse of the software tools by other institutions, companies or partners and therefore provides. These platform in this sense triggers direct debate on the status of ICT in the humanities.  

In times of big data more and more data is available but not necessary turned into knowledge. The Coding the Humanities platform educates students, researchers and non-technologically biased people on how to approach this data. It allows its participants to gain insights by addressing these dataset. The CtH projects and tools are therefore easily relateable to already existing open data movements - it seeks to provide its users with digital agency that evolves into debates on open data.

The platform will embrace open source culture and open licenses. The students share their code projects on a distributed repository which encourages re-use, altering and further development. This platform is therefore open, inclusive and sustainable.

**Technical approach**

On the technical side the design of the platform is inspired by and makes use of open source software and the attached collaborative strategies.

Users make a profile on GitHub, an online public platform for maintaining and sharing repositories that has distributed version control (each user has access to all versions of all documents in the project and can modify existing projects). Their profiles contain all their work, every single contribution to their repositories, which encourages sharing and reuse but also provides them with a portfolio which shows their skills. This portfolio increases the employability of humanities students in addition to serving as a documentation site. 

The platform is developed in JavaScript, which will also be the main programming language that is used on the platform. JavaScript is the language that is used on most websites and in all modern web browsers to let the user interact with the web. The advantage of using JavaScript is that it gives users access to the full stack of technologies: client-side, server-side and database levels can be controlled with JavaScript. With it, programmers can interact with data on any website and any web platform. JavaScript also combines the major programming paradigms, so users switching to other programming languages will recognise many elements and don't need to start from scratch.

All interaction with the platform is done via the web browser. All modern browsers allow users to directly interact with web sites and servers through the browser console using JavaScript. Thereby users can directly apply their coding skills to anything they encounter on the web. Another advantage is that this minimises the threshold to developing and using programming skills, as web browsers are found on most computers and are provided by default with all popular operating systems. At the same time, using JavaScript in the browser exposes users to the full range of programming possibilities.

Furthermore, the platform is tool oriented. Students develop small tools and widgets that perform small parts of the research they want to conduct. The reason to focus on tools is that researchers in general and humanities scholars in particular need to reflect critically on the tools they use for their research. By becoming proficient at conceptualising and developing tools, scholars develop a keen eye for perceiving how digital tools work in general. 

Developments in programming languages have shifted the focus from computation to language. Commands in modern programming languages are more like natural language expressions, whereas older languages forced programmers to formulate very algebraic commands. This makes modern languages more intuitive to use, which lowers the threshold and together with the vast number of interesting JavaScript modules available on the web, even novice programmers can build interesting applications in a matter of hours or days instead of months or years. Promoting programming skills to a large audience makes more sense now than ever before.

**User Experience**

The users of the platform will acquire programming skills via modular online courses and tutorials with direct visual feedback and the ability to concurrently work on the same code and copy and comment on each others work in real-time. This approach encourages peer learning and collaboration.

The platform is set up in such a way that universities can integrate learning modules from CtH in their curriculum, while students can build up their portfolios through research projects, with which they can show both their progress to teachers and their skills and achievements to (future) employers. Furthermore, as was indicated about the application, it integrates naturally with Github and other open source environments, lowering the threshold for a diverse audience to reuse, copy and extend the prototypes, products and results of interest to society, including the general public, academics and companies.

The platform will be introduced to students for the University of Amsterdam with an accompanying offline course that allows students to earn ECT points. This phase will be followed by public release. 


##### 1.3.3.2 The Lab as Interface

Universities are opening up towards other universities, civic movements and companies, so that other groups can benefit from and enrich their knowledge.

This process of opening up can be accelerated by spaces that are situated in between the involved actors. The "living lab" we propose shows how this can lead to innovation. The physical lab provices a space for embedded research, a place for "overlapping", theory and artistic practice, physical and digital research, of studio, workshop, library, of institutions - private and public, an independent place 

**Introduction** 

One of the challenges concerning new forms of online learning is to form a community of participants that are interested to engage with a platform over a longer period of time and actively contribution to sustainable projects. This sub-project addresses these challenges by the design and production of an offline living lab as interface between digital and analogue world.

As a user-driven methodology, Living Labs aim to blur the boundaries between technology users and producers by including (future) users of technologies from the start of technology development. Positioning users as co-creators reverses traditional “top-down” R&D-processes performed by companies in favour of “bottom-up” innovation, performed by users and grounded in society instead of in research laboratories. This practice is to lead to unexpected insights into user ideas and practices (Almirall, 2008: 43 Almirall, E. (2008). Living Labs and Open Innovation: Roles and Applicability. The Electronic Journal for Virtual Organizations and Networks, 10(August), 21–46) and lead to the development of more successful ICTs.
To gain unexpected insights, methodologies focus on the inclusion of real (end) users in  daily life contexts. The Living Lab thus also comprises a setting; a setting that affords “experimentation environments in which technology is given shape in real life context and in which (end) users are considered co-producers” (Ballon et al., 2005: 13 Ballon, P., Delaere, S., Pierson, J., M, P., Slot, M., Bierhof, J., & Diocaretz, M. (2005). Test & Experimentation Platforms for Broadband Innovation: Conceptualizing and Benchmarking International Best Practice).

This living lab, the OverLab, will explore the integration and complementation of ICT based learning and collaboration into an offline environment. It will serve as a testbed to initiate, support and foster online ICT projects. At the same time, the strategies and practices of the analogue space inform the development of the digital platform. Innovative perspectives on the application of ICT in general and its integration into an offline space will be explored through experimental, user focused workshops that result in a physical space. The conception and design of the lab according to user needs is a crucial part within this subproject. 
This approach will produce models and concepts for the design and user culture of a living lab that feeds of and informs the online learning platform. The process will be openly documented and intends the imitation and formation of living labs related to the coding the humanities platform.  

The initial users of this interface are researchers that are situated in between a variety of aspects themselves: Embedded researchers work between theory and (artistic) practice, physical and digital research, science and art, universities and public or private partners. Their needs as digital knowledge worker on the one hand and a specific but homogeneous group on the other hand, allow valuable insights concerning the question of how ICT can provide instruments to make research more open, accessible and sustainable. 

It will be an independent place outside the department structure of the university in which studio, workshop and library intertwine, a room that enables and allows to experiment.

**Project Overview** 

Embedded researcher is a new and exciting role within the university. Its goal is to establish sustainable partnerships between private partners and universities. In practice, however, this turns out to be problematic, since the role and position of this kind of researcher is peripheral by definition. The embedded researcher usually works on short term projects and in between the academy and a company which seeks to establish sustainable collaborations between the creative industries and universities. Though the future of research lies more and more in collaborations between disciplines and fields, between public and private partnerships, practice and theory, between classic methodology and flexible theory, co-creation and collaborations the interdisciplinary researcher enters work spaces which are not built by or for them and uses methodology and means of exposure which remain in the respective fields.

Where artists use their atelier, designers their studio and scientists their lab for experimentation, testing and collaboration, the embedded researcher enters a traditional, disciplinary university environment even though they are often expected to address research questions with a practical and creative research aspect. But artistic expression and creativity do not obey closing hours and bureaucratic sterility of university buildings.

A virtual and physical lab is essential to compensate for the aforementioned problems. An online and offline platform - that already exists before they start, and will start after their contracts end - a space is a necessary precondition for embedded research projects that are actually sustainable. In this project we want to explore how such a lab should look like. Therefore this project seeks to investigate and built upon the combined needs for newly established forms of research by means of self-reflective research by the combined skills and expertise of the public and private partner using design thinking.  

Therefore this project seeks to investigate and built upon the combined needs for newly established forms of research by means of self-reflective research by the combined skills and expertise of the public and private partner using design thinking. 
When working from a human-centered approach it is crucial to not think of the form of the outcome right away or to be limited to just one medium or technology. But in order to experiment and innovate, a flexible workspace is as much needed as a flexible methodological framework which stimulates creating research designs with specific tools. 

**Challenge** 
The work space of the embedded researchers are regular office spaces at the university, supplied with a desk and a computer. The scope of most projects however requires a variety of work settings. When working from a human-centered approach it is crucial to not think of the form of the outcome right away or to be limited to just one medium or technology. But in order to experiment and innovate, a flexible workspace is needed. Artistic expression and creativity do not obey closing hours and bureaucratic sterility of university buildings. 
How could the ideal workspace for knowledge workers look like? How could the working environment be adapted to meet the changed research requirements of knowledge workers at the Departments for Digital Humanities, Media Studies, Cultural Analysis and Artistic Research? How can these physical structures create a sustainable link with an online learning environment? And how can the analogue and digital workspaces best be linked to each other? 


**How to: user-centered approach Design Thinking**

Future University related research has to be informed by open methodologies. Increasingly funding is spread competitively for small research periods, also in order to foster the collaboration between the public and the private sector, for example in the form of embedded researchers. Even though the emphasis here is on sustainable research, the projects are often closed and presented and not open for further development (unless some additional funding allows to proceed) Truely sustainable research is OPEN and would mean that a project has releases - at some point (after the official end of the research period) other students, embedded researchers are allowed and encouraged to take the outcome of the research, alter and develop it further. At some point (after the official end of the research period) other students, embedded researchers are allowed and encouraged to take the outcome of the research, alter and develop it further. 


Need
- increasing need of knowledge workers to combine theoretical as well as hands-on approaches in their research
- current workspaces do not provide enough space, the right material and technology to experiment
- methodological framework for researching interdisciplinary methodology
- best practice for building sustainable public-private-partnerships



##### 1.3.3.3 Collections as Interfaces


Collection as an interface: the exploration of the opportunities interfaces and visualization of data holds for knowledge production and inclusion

There are not only dramatic geographic differences in accessibility to and user skills of ICT but also socio-economic and demographic gaps (Chinn and Fairly). Vast societal groups face the problem of digital exclusion. Accessibility to and digital literacy about ICTs determine whether a person is included into economic, social and cultural life, and whether they can participate in decision making processes within the democratic realm. In other words, using and comprehending ICT is about agency and inclusion. With regard to the growing impact of ICT not only on economic productivity but also within the cultural, social and political realm, this exclusion forms a challenge in terms of equality, inclusion and chances of participation.

One area in which the challenge of digital literacy and exclusion is prominent is within humanities research. Academia is increasingly confronted with large amounts of data. In order to turn this data into information and into knowledge, researchers and students need tools that allow to structure, search, correlate, analyze, but most importantly present and visualize this data. This is also true for working fields related to the humanities: museums, libraries and archives are challenged to make the huge data sets that result from digitalization of the cultural heritage they foster //opencultuur.nl//, accessible and understandable for as many people as possible. Despite the opportunities these mass resources generated in numerous digitization projects provide, humanities researchers and students are – due to a lack of skills - reluctant to exploit these troves.

//"While digital resources are becoming more visible in the humanities, use of these resources by scholars remains limited. … Digitization projects are bringing texts, data sources, sound, and images to the scholar’s desktop; however, the functions on which research in the humanities depend are neither well understood nor well supported by librarians."// (Brockman et al, 2001) / Bradley Text

At the same time, governments, municipalities and cultural institutions increasingly share their data openly online. The skills to compile graspable information from big data sets become more important on the level of politics and social agency. It allows civic movements but also single citizens to understand political and social processes, identify problems and develop solutions – that can be software based. //gelt project // white house data // open knowledge foundation//.

Coding the Humanities trains students and researchers to read and handle data streams and shows possible ways to translate these into visualizations. Visualizations such as cartography, timelines, graphs, diagrams or animations, as well as the design of interactive interfaces help to translate data into knowledge by providing a context for different information and a combination of different data sets. This approach can boost humanities research and at the same time it makes humanities concepts and research productive and understandable for a broader audience as the visual translation of the data can inspire the mind to new insights.

In practice, the choice is made to encourage researchers to first learn to program in JavaScript; JavaScript has a low threshold for the practical application of code in various fields. Here the researchers can also experiment with and apply their knowledge to existing open code resources. In addition to this, existing visualization applications and programs - such as cartography, timelines, graphs, diagrams or animations - are made available to humanities’ researchers. Combining newly developed JavaScript coding skills with enhanced visualization applications literacy, allows humanities’ researchers to elicit new knowledge and scientific insights by experimenting with existing JavaScript libraries such as D3 (Data Driven Documents) http://d3js.org/ while also gaining good control over the visual outcome of their research endeavors. These tools thus enhance the analysis and understanding of complex relations and concepts relevant to humanities’ research. At the same time data sets become comprehensible and presentable to a broader audience. Supported by private partners in the consortium, researchers will also develop new tools that may be applied to different open data sets, provided by cultural institutions and organizations. 

The developed tools can be applied to different data sets. Especially with regard to the above mentioned open data sets provided by more and more cultural institutions and organizations, data visualization tools provide a great foundation for collaborative activities between universities and other institutions. These tools allow to exceed the mode of mere data processing to the actual production of new insights and knowledge.

Practically, the foreseen educational platform realizes local engagement, user-focused learning with both an individually-oriented as well as collective component; collaboration and the accumulation of knowledge and skills are key to a successful implementation of the platform. Apart from a digital educational platform and the realization of a physical research space where public-private-civic partners can collaborate, a third component of the project is the translation of data in intuitive interfaces and data visualization. Students and researchers (“users”) will be taught to translate data into visualization, thereby not only learning how to interpret data, but also how to code and reflect on what coding practices mean; how the act of coding influences how data is represented. Users, in this way, become more aware of how data may be manipulated while at the same time gaining skills that empower the user. By learning how to read and handle data streams and how these may be translated in visualizations, users therefore not only gain skills, but also become more empowered, “smart” users. Moreover, data visualization tools provide a great foundation for collaborative activities between universities and other institutions; these tools move beyond the mode of mere data processing to instead produce new insights and knowledge.

The project thus involves visualization and interface expertise of private partners to not merely facilitate and realize skilling of humanities’ researchers, but to moreover stimulate new knowledge production. Directly connected to this is the fact that the consortium is complemented by open data collections provided by museums. These open data collections provide research material for humanities researchers to interact with, to investigate and to draw new knowledge from.

The exhibition would be a combination of on and offline projects, culminating in a public six week exhibition in the Museum Square in Vienna three years into the project. We endeavor to involve students from the platform, partners from the lab space, as well as other private and public partners, developers, and the general population. This exhibition would consist of workshops, data events, speakers, art installations, and presentations on relationships between ITC, art, business, and cultural heritage.

This also relates to the second part of the Collection as Interface sub-project; the research performed by consortium of actors will culminate in a public six week exhibition, situated in the Museum Square in Vienna in the third year of the project. Involving and drawing from the research practices of students on the platform, the partners in the lab space and the general population, the exhibition publicly presents workshops, art installations and events about the relationship between ICT, art, business and cultural heritage. Situated in public space, the exhibition invites the public to engage with art work, developed interfaces, and visualizations which are the result of researchers’ efforts in researching open data provided by cultural institutions.

The exhibition will be presented in the third year of the project. However, at the end of the first year, a trial event will be organized in Vienna, where first results are to be presented. Between the first and third year, the consortium will work on realizing the six week exhibition through crowdfunding mechanisms, such as kickstarter (www.kickstart.com)  


**Consortium** 

In this research field we work with the Dutch company Weyeser with expertise in supporting organizations to translate big amounts of data into knowledge by means of data mining, machine learning and visualization. Their solutions offer governments, governmental institutions, universities, think tanks and corporations ways of objectively assessing their knowledge portfolio and that of their peers. Within the framework of CtH, Weyeser supports humanities students in the analysis and visualization of humanities’ related data sets relevant to their research.

Weyeser’s expertise with visualization and interfacing-practices is complemented by the Austrian company CastYourArt. CastYourArt is focused on consulting, production and online/offline distribution of audio and video material in which they present artists, exhibitions and collectors and take art out of the museum context.

The public partners involved are the Royal Tropical Institute, a research institute with five Dutch museums attached and Europeana, the network of European libraries, archives and other cultural institutions.


//We would love to initiate a collaboration between you and the private/public partners that allows Coding the Humanities researchers and students to explore new formats to make data and information related to museum collections accessible and experienceable. With regard to the private partners these explorations could involve the conception and development of visualizations in general terms, as video or audio and/or in form of interfaces.// 

//In a series of workshops the students/researchers should learn about the status quo of visualization within the museums context. Their humanities background then allows them to comprehend how to turn data into a narrative and thus develop perspectives on how address visitors in new ways. With their coding skills and the support of the private partner, the students will collectively conceptualize and develop software solutions for field but not limited to this field.//

//Europeana would provide us with API access, advice and critique from an institutionalised repository, and participate in joint meetings and publications. In terms of budget we should make sure they get a travel budget (€2,000 per year?), and some time (for participation and contributions). We will need to check with Jill to see if that is ok and how much they need for time, but I would guess that about €10-15K per year would be more than enough.//


Moreover, the consortium in this research field will be completed by a public partner, the Tropenmuseum Amsterdam, which will initiate projects that encourage students to work with the datasets related to their collection. In a series of workshops with the private and the public partner the students will learn about the status quo of visualization within the museums context. With their humanities background the students are predestined to comprehend how to turn data into a narrative and how to meet the demands of the visitor. With their coding skills and the support of the private partner, the students will collective conceptualize and develop software solutions for this field but not limited to this field. The outcome of this project will be accessible and free to use by other students, scholars, cultural institutions or civic movements.  

Visualization empowers the students to make the increasing number of large datasets productive for their research. The new perspectives gained also provide arguments and strategies for a larger audience ranging from museums to foundations to civic movements.


*Describe any national or international research and innovation activities which will be linked with the project, especially where the outputs from these will feed into the project;*

//CIRCA// //ADH// //http://www.lifeparticipation.org// Action 60: Increase participation of women in the ICT workforce
[https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/pillar-vi-enhancing-digital-literacy-skills-and-inclusion/action-60-increase-participation-women-ict](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/pillar-vi-enhancing-digital-literacy-skills-and-inclusion/action-60-increase-participation-women-ict)


*Describe and explain the overall approach, distinguishing, as appropriate, coordination and support activities;* 

* The overall approach to this project is to stimulate both self-empowerment and at the same time, collaboration, between those working in the humanities those outside academia. This will be done by offering PhD positions, encouraging embedded research activities, and working together with Design Thinking companies for fruitful interaction in the physical lab. There is already an extensive amount of coordination between the University of Amsterdam and outside institutions for this project. Productive meetings with several companies have taken place, including Dark Horse.  

*Where relevant, describe how sex and/or gender analysis is taken into account in the project’s content.*

This project is about empowering people to use technology, concentrating on those who are hesitant or face obstacles to do so. Girls and women overall face greater obstacles to accessing technology and education in general. Raising awareness of this issue, fostering discussion on feminism and coding, and working to create new ways of increasing the participation of girls and women in coding are all essential elements to our project.

previously unmet needs that can be met by bringing sex and gender into the research: addressing the roots of the divide between women and men in technology

equipping more girls and women with coding skills will enable them to create tools that they need, which have been overlooked in the male-dominated world of coding and technology in general. 

- The number of woman attracted by coding within CtH could be increased by collaborations with initiatives that seek to do the same - increase the number of female coders, like Railsgirls [http://railsgirls.com/](http://railsgirls.com/) or geekettes [http://www.geekettes.io/](http://www.geekettes.io/) in forms of workshops, information evenings in the lab.

A recent EU study shows that only 30% of the people in the ICT sector in Europe are women, a number that mirrors the low number of women with a degree in that field. [Digital Agenda: Bringing more women into EU digital sector would bring €9 billion annual GDP boost, EU study shows](http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-13-905_en.htm) While the same study shows the potential of having more woman working in that field traditional ICT programs fail to attract female students. At the same time female students in the humanities outnumber male students. Thus an approach like CtH holds enormous potential to engage more women in ICT via their research interests. The seminar *Coding the Humanities* at the University of Amsterdam has shown that, in combination with tools relevant to their research, woman are as keen as men to engage with coding. 

*Sex and gender refer to biological characteristics and social/cultural factors respectively. For guidance on methods of sex / gender analysis and the issues to be taken into account, please refer to [http://ec.europa.eu/research/science-society/gendered-innovations/index_en.cfm](http://ec.europa.eu/research/science-society/gendered-innovations/index_en.cfm)*


### 2. Impact 


#### 2.1 Expected impacts 

*Please be specific, and provide only information that applies to the proposal and its objectives. Wherever possible, use quantified indicators and targets.*

*Describe how your project will contribute to the expected impacts set out in the work programme, under the relevant topic;*

*Describe any barriers/obstacles, and any framework conditions (such as regulation and standards), that may determine whether and to what extent the expected impacts will be achieved. (This should not include any risk factors concerning implementation, as covered in section 3.2.)* 
2. Impact

2.1 Expected impacts

The main goal of the project is to reach and train a large number of humanities students, researchers and scholars and initiate collaboration through coding projects and a debate about the digital tools in use. This goal will be pursued through active involvement of students and researchers on the online interface, the use of the offline lab, collaborations with universities, organizations and private partners.

On a larger scope the project will provide an online learning platform that is freely accessible and contains collection digital tools that can be re-used, adapted or developed further. The platform therefore holds the potential of enabling and equipping a large number of non-technologically biased people to use these and other tools according to their needs. In order make this project known to potentially digitally excluded persons Coding the Humanities seeks to facilitate collaborations with diverse partners, such as knowledge institutes, civic movements and municipals. 

This hands on approach will train thousands of humanities students to develop digital agency and at the same time seeks to interests many potentially digitally excluded persons and train them to collaboratively expand their coding skills and to pass on this knowledge. Every active user therefore become a collaborator and multiplyer.

*Targets* 

As concrete targets we intent to:

- have 20.000 active users of the online platform after four years
- have at least 50 regular users of the physical lab 
- have the model of the lab implemented by at least four other public or private institutions 
- reach at least 1000 people workshops, presentations, hackathons with varying levels of technological knowledge
- to give presentations together with the private partners on at least 5 conferences / symposiums per year  
- involve international digital/media artists and reach and involve hundreds of visitors of the fare for digital devices in Vienna in 2017 

*Reaching these goals*

*University of Amsterdam*

The three offline courses "Art, Science, and Technology", "Coding the Humanities", "From Objected Data" initiate the participation on the platform with 20 students per course, 60 students in total in 2014 and create a awareness of the project before the official release.

In the following years four courses (12 ECT) per year starting 2015 will reach 320 students. These students are meant to work as tutors and pass on their knowledge to other humanities students and engage with them in projects based on their research interests.

During the same time 40 embedded researchers will use the online interface and the pilot and the actual physical lab. The experience gained for the work within this analogue and digital collaborative space, naturally integrates into their research which is aimed at modeling a product or service for a cultural institution with regard to the digital enhancement the services.


*Best (good) practice models for other universities and organizations*

Collaborations with at least four other universities with humanities departments equal in size to that of the faculty of humanities of the University of Amsterdam (7.000 students) will introduce the platform on an international level to a large goup of humanities students and scholars. These universities integrate the platform into their curriculum. Coding the Humanities will provide scholars from the other universities with consultation on the implementation of the platform in the coursework.

The success of these collaborations can be directly measured through the number of participating students and of their portfolios on github. Among the involved humanities scholars an active exchange about the integration of the platform into their teaching will be initiated and curated by Coding the Humanities communications staff. 

Coding the Humanities will furthermore reach out to initiatives like the open knowledge foundation, railsgirls and research centers like the Creative Industries Research Centre Amsterdam and Centre for Digital Humanities Amsterdam to diversify and enlarge the usergroup further.

*Public and Private Partners* 

The direct cooperation with different SMEs will allow for the co-development of products and services and thus include another perspective into the digital tools needed in humanities teaching and education. 

*Events*

All findings, for example in form of reports, presentation, videos, design blueprints, and the code generated in the project will be documented and accessible online. The project manager of Coding the Humanities will initiate a series of events that points the awareness groups with various levels of technical knowledge to these tools and the interface itself. Furthermore, the project will be presented at various conferences, symposia and conventions in the field of education and software.  

Via the online interface, the physical space and a series of events, Coding the Humanities is going to reach and empower a diverse audience of people different levels of programming and technological knowledge. The mix of hands on courses and tutorials and offline workshops will empower humanities students to enter a dialogue on the impact of digital tools on their research and ways of collaboration.  

The collaboration with different institutions and organizations will increase the diversity of participants and loosen up the homogeneous group of humanities researchers. The development of services and products related to humanities research but also aimed at the needs of a larger public (for example knowledge institutions) ensure that the dialogue about digital tools exceeds an abstract realm which is not user centered and evolves between ICT experts. Instead it includes a diverse groups of a new kind of enabled users. 


#### 2.2 Measures to maximise impact

**a) Dissemination and exploitation of results** 

*Provide a draft ‘plan for disseminating and exploiting the project’s results’ (unless the work programme topic explicitly states that such a plan is not required). The plan, which should be proportionate to the scale of the project, should contain measures to be implemented both during and after the project;*  
exploitation measure: consultancy, acting as consultants for companies, for instance in coding, best practices for development, best practices for coding. 

//The result will be an increased learning from experience, a boosted transferability of results and, as a consequence, an increased lasting effect of the supported activities//
//Horizon 2020 plays a central role in the delivery of the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth and acts as a vehicle for leveraging private investment, creating new job opportunities//
//The result will be an increased learning from experience, a boosted transferability of results and, as a consequence, an increased lasting effect of the supported activities.//

*Dissemination and exploitation measures should address the full range of potential users and uses including research, commercial, investment, social, environmental, policy making, setting standards, skills and educational training.* 

*The approach to innovation should be as comprehensive as possible, and must be tailored to the specific technical, market and organisational issues to be addressed.* 
 
*Explain how the proposed measures will help to achieve the expected impact of the project. Include a business plan where relevant;*

*Where relevant, include information on how the participants will manage the research data generated and/or collected during the project, in particular addressing the following issues:*

*What types of data will the project generate/collect?*

*What standards will be used?*

*How will this data be exploited and/or shared/made accessible for verification and re-use? If data cannot be made available, explain why.*

*How will this data be curated and preserved?*  

*You will need an appropriate consortium agreement to manage (amongst other things) the ownership and access to key knowledge (IPR, data etc.). These will allow you, collectively and individually, to pursue market opportunities arising from the project's results.*  

*Outline the strategy for knowledge management and protection. Include measures to provide open access (free on-line access such as the ‘green’ or ‘gold’ model) to peer-reviewed scientific publications which might result from the project.*

*Open access publishing (also called 'gold' open access) means that an article is immediately provided in open access mode by the scientific publisher. The associated costs are usually shifted away from readers, and instead (for example) to the university or research institute to which the researcher is affiliated, or to the funding agency supporting the research.* 

*Self-archiving (also called 'green' open access) means that the published article or the final peer-reviewed manuscript is archived by the researcher - or a representative - in an online repository before, after or alongside its publication. Access to this article is often - but not necessarily - delayed (‘embargo period’) as some scientific publishers may wish to recoup their investment by selling subscriptions and charging pay-per-download/view fees during an exclusivity period.*


**b) Communication activities**

Find a draft and bulletpoints on this section [here](https://github.com/yeehaa123/erc/blob/master/h2020/proposal/2.2.b_Communication%20activities_best%20practices_process%20documentation.md)

Describe the proposed communication measures for promoting the project and its findings during the period of the grant. Measures should be proportionate to the scale of the project, with clear objectives.  They should be tailored to the needs of various audiences, including groups beyond the project’s own community. Where relevant, include measures for public/societal engagement on issues related to the project. 

Overall Deliverable: Make learnings and models available in best practices and libraries.

## Communication activities
### Towards a format of cross-medial process documentation 

####what? 

- combining sub-projects into a larger communication framework, which includes libraries, software and on-/offline best practices 
- to share the knowledge from building the different sub-projects 
- develop further the process documentation and medial communication of larger research projects
- display and exposure of the project through various media and communication channels

Science communication is a constituting element of research and learning in order to bridge the gap between science and society. However, many of the new medial possiblities, and above all interactive interfaces, aren't strongly developed yet. The research centers *innokom* and *Stifterverband* conclude in their trend study on science communication, that the step towards "an open-result-oriented, societally engaged dialogue is overdue. Drivers behind this development are new formats in interactive media." (*Gerber, Alexander (2011): Trendstudie Wissenschaftskommunikation – Vorhang auf für Phase 5. Berlin: edition innovare / innokomm Forschungszentrum, p.24*) Until now, science communication has been communication by the universities' press office, who pubslished research results with gate keeper principles. Which means that the results were communicated further depending on whether or not print, tv or radio would pick up on it. 

There can be identified two main reasons for science communication not reaching beyond an academic public: Either scientists don't have the necessary skill set in order to act as communicators and media designers, or the media professionals try to squeeze scientific content into the standardized storytelling they know from corporate films or TV reports. 
The newly emerged field of eLearning and MOOC's possesses great possibilities for the distribution of knowledge and exchange. However, there are currently few examples of projects or courses where the promises of moving images are used to their fullest, and where the different field of expertise of academic teachers, videographers and students result in products which reflect their research content in the best possible way.

#### our approach
- the project partners's expertise include both media professionals as well as researchers. Throughout the project they will attend workshops in order to reflect on the forms of scientific communication and test it's range through a variety of comunication activities (see below).
- this project has a complex structure, uses a variety of technology, adresses and includes different audiences

#### how?

- cross-medial best practice 
- built a bridge between the concrete implementation of video, learning and collecting as one part 
of the overall platform
- use format of Scientific Research Trailer as a point-of-departure; produce video sequences which use filmic language and do justice to the respective research topic and people who conduct the research.
- research which media can be used for science communication in which way

#### who? 
## who else should be included here?????????

All of the private partners are strong communicators and multipliers in their respective fields. Each of them will  

Johanna Barnbeck is an artist, researcher and creative professional offering creative consulting for universities and research institutes who want to use audiovisual media in order to reach their relevant public. 
She develops concepts for film, photography and crossmedial art projects. Currently, she also works as an embedded researcher on the project Augmenting Masterpieces at the Rijksmuseum, which seeks to develop interfaces between the digital and the physical collection of the museum.
(If specification is useful: In this project she will be giving workshops regarding best practice cases and their formats.)

## b) Communication activities

Iteration of all of those activities in order to build strong cases regarding science communication and develop further storytelling strategies for researchers.

- Curation of the physical lab includes a variety of communication activities
  - every 6 months throughout 3 years: project exhibition of the process 
  - every 3 months throughout 3 years: symposium with workshops and speakers / party 
  - monthly: Digital Salon/ Digital Workshop/ Presentations to all Project partners
  - Workshops and Pilots 
  - Grand finale in order to end the four year collaborative research partnership with Dark Horse and mark the moment of complete independency

- Science slams / Pecha Kucha's
- presenting project results at different types of conferences: developer-, educational-, heritage-, humanities-oriented (here we need representation costs). We're reaching commercial companies and various kinds of institutions.

- use kickstarter and crowdfunding to finance and promote the exhibition. This is also good for societal engagement.

- challenge students (a.k.a. researchers or users) to collaborate on projects with people outside their courses and universities.

- the Coding Sessions workshops that we're already organising reaches all kinds of new users.

- announce projects and (hackathon) challenges via Europeana. As a massive European portal for thousands of heritage institutions, such announcements will reach enormous audiences.

- by involving other universities in using and developing courses, the project is promoted in different countries

- Exhibition of the Collections sub-project generates massive media attention and a very broad audience.



### 3. Implementation

#### 3.1	Work plan – Work packages, deliverables and milestones

*Please provide the following:*

*brief presentation of the overall structure of the work plan* 

The proposed project is structured into three fields: 

1) The Platform as Interface 
In this work package an online platform for learning and research will be conceptualized by offering programming training to humanities students. It will serve as a forum for a wider user group and will engender fruitful collaborations in learning new technologies. 

2) The Lab as Interface is to be an offline space that complements the online platform and provides an in-between environment for university partners, in addition to public and private partners to connect and pool their skills and perspectives towards innovations.

3) The Collection as Interface will be an exploration of the inclusive opportunities interfaces and visualization of data holds for knowledge production.


Inspired by open source culture and software development practices the fields are going to be explored simulataneously so that insights from one of the fields can be applied tranfered early on to the other fields.

Collections as Interfaces: 


*You should give enough detail in each work package to justify the proposed resources to be allocated and also quantified information so that progress can be monitored, including by the Commission.* 

*You are advised to include a distinct work package on ‘Management’ (see section 3.2), and to give due visibility in the work plan to ‘dissemination and exploitation’ and ‘communication activities’, either with distinct tasks, or possibly distinct work packages.* 

*You will be required to include an updated (or confirmed) plan for ‘dissemination and exploitation’ in both the mid-term and final reports. (This does not apply to topics where a draft plan was not required.) This should include a record of activities related to dissemination and exploitation that have been undertaken, and those still planned. A report of completed and planned communication activities will also be required.* 

*If your project is taking part in the Pilot on Open Research Data, you must include a 'data management plan' as a distinct deliverable within the first 6 months of the project. A template for such a plan is given in the guidelines on data management in the H2020 Online Manual. This deliverable will evolve during the lifetime of the project in order to present the status of the project's reflections on data management.*

**Definitions:**

**Work package** *means a major sub-division of the proposed project*

**Deliverable** *means a distinct output of the project, meaningful in terms of the project’s  overall objectives, and constituted by a report, a document, a technical diagram, a software etc.*

**‘Milestones’** *means control points in the project that help to chart progress. Milestones may correspond to the completion of a key deliverable, allowing the next phase of the work to begin. They may also be needed at intermediary points so that, if problems have arisen, corrective measures can be taken. A milestone may be a critical decision point in the project where, for example, the consortium must decide which of several technologies to adopt for further development.*

#### 3.2	Management structure and procedures 
 
*Describe the organisational structure and the decision-making (including a list of milestones (table 3.2a));*
We have the idea for a horizontal management structure that ensures private partners are not able to take over -- connection will be made via workshops and meetings. Our resistance to hierarcy requires a careful explanation as to structure and how decisions are made. We will enact a policy of frequent but strictly time-controlled meetings via skype with partners to discuss progress and plans ahead. Each person present in a meeting may voice their opinion, and each person will have a veto, which they should use carefully. However, each partner will have a lead participant who serves as the representative of that organization related to the project. This role will rotate every six months, allowing all main participants to represent their organization. The project managers will play a coordination role in making sure meetings are well organized and effective. Twice per year, all participants, not only the leaders, will meet in person for a conference. At these conferences, everyone is encouraged to concisely share what they think the one thing is that could move the innovation forward. 
Github is an excellent platform to collect ideas and share feedback, allowing for open discussion and a well informed decision making process. 

*Explain why the organisational structure and decision-making mechanisms are appropriate to the complexity and scale of the project;*
This organizational structure involves each partner or component to the project having one representative at a time. This allows for a smaller group to participate in decision making. Because the partners in this project are physically located in several different countries within the European Union, having one representative attend monthly meetings is more manageable. Meeting regularly is condusive to our value of collaboration.

*Describe, where relevant, how effective innovation management will be addressed  in the management structure and work plan;*


*Innovation management is a process which requires an understanding of both market and technical problems, with a goal of successfully implementing appropriate creative ideas. A new or improved product, service or process is its typical output. It also allows a consortium to respond to an external or internal opportunity.*

*Describe any critical risks, relating to project implementation, that the stated project’s objectives may not be achieved. Detail any risk mitigation measures. Please provide a table with critical risks identified and mitigating actions (table 3.2b).*

#### 3.3	Consortium as a whole 

*The individual members of the consortium are described in a separate section 4. There is no need to repeat that information here.* 

*Describe the consortium. How will it match the project’s objectives? How do the members complement one another (and cover the value chain, where appropriate)? In what way does each of them contribute to the project? How will they be able to work effectively together?* 

The consortium for the proposed project consists of the public institutions University of Amsterdam (UvA) and Europeana complemented by the private partners CastYourArt (AT), The Dark Horse (D) and Weyeser (NL). 

The constellation allows the consortium to look at and discuss the role of ICT in education and teaching from various perspectives. Each partner adds another expertise to the project that enables to develop the concrete online platform, the offline lab and the test case of a concrete applicable tools. At the same time is every partner is feeding into the dialog and debate with students, researchers and scholars about that the possibilities and limitations of ICT related knowledge production. This input is thus informed by their experience from former projects but also derives from the concrete development of solutions for ICT applications within the framework of the project.   

The University of Amsterdam will bring in the insights gained during the three above mentioned coding related seminars with students conducted in 2013/2014 to conceptualize the needs of humanities students for the development of the platform. Further information for the development of the different platform components will be introduced by the design thinking company The Dark Horse with its experience in the conceptions of online interface. Together with one software developer members of the UvA are going develop the platform itself and benefit form the knowledge about visualization strategies brought into the project by the dutch company weyeser.  

In a series of workshops The Dark Horse will apply their user focused strategies to analyze the needs of students and researchers concerning an offline lab that can stimulate and enhance the use of ICT based learning processes and collaborations. The Dark Horse is experienced in the conception and design of spaces that are situated between on- and offline word. They will be committed to the actual design of a lab in Amsterdam of which serves as a blueprint in terms of design and collaborative working practices for similar labs.    

The two interfaces described above form the working basis for the actual development of coding projects that feed from the expertise, encountered audience related challenges and data sets of the Europeana network. The challenges pointed out by Europeana representatives in a series of workshops will be discussed and approach by students and researchers of the UvA. CastYourArt and weyeser will initiate discussions and projects with the students that will produce software solutions that interface digitized cultural heritage with an potential audience. 

A series of events that follow up events initiated by the UvA in 2013/2014 ("datadrive", "codingsessions") will be organized together with the private partners in form of workshops, hackathon and presentations and ensure that the produced outcome of the student projects and the knowledge generated by the partners involved is made known to a bigger audience. The project the students projects will finally be presented in an exhibition in Vienna. This exhibition will be organized, curated and documented by CastYourArt.  

Wrap-up the different roles:
The UvA trains the students, The Dark Horse develops models form the experience of the students for the online and offline platform and the interrelation of the two. Europeana provides challenges and data-sets for the students projects. weyeser supports the students in their projects and co-develops the online platform with the UvA. CastYourArt also supports the students in their projects, organizes, curates and documents the exhibition. 

All of the achieved insights are documented in form of presentations, evaluations forms, reports, video and code on an open online repository accessible through the online learning platform.

##### Dark Horse GmbH & Co KG  
Ritterstraße 12 - 14  
Aufgang 4, Etage 3  
10969 Berlin  
Germany

*Dark Horse* is an innovation agency based in Berlin which creates user-centered products and services and helps clients to change their structures, processes and minds. Their work is based on Design Thinking principles and their own unusual working culture that simultaneously stresses ﬂexibility and connections. They design spatial, procedural and social conditions of collaboration in on- and offline settings. Guided by their participative design approach, they created spaces and working culture for collaboration in science and creative industry.

Within the proposed project Dark Horse is going to conduct research on and develop a conceptual framework and design for a physical space that accompanies and complements the online learning platform. Their user centered approach and the background in anthropology and interior design allows Lisa Zoth and Patrick Kenzler to understand and translate the requirements of such a space into a practical design concept and the according user culture. They will provide an answer to the crucial question of how online collaboration and innovative practice can be initiated, accelerated and fostered through an offline setting. Moreover their research will provide insights to the students’ needs that cannot be satisfied merely by the application of ICT but are better addressed with a combination of digital instruments and offline collaboration and training methods.

*Lisa Zoth* has a background in political science and anthropology. She has conducted several projects in regard to the implementation of the Design Thinking Methodology and Culture into companies such as SAP or Deutsche Bahn. Her research focus lies on the design of organizational collaboration and implementing innovation processes into traditional structures. Lisa Zoth will in this project be mainly involved in the need finding, synthesis and ideation phase of the project and evaluating the collaboration processes among the embedded researchers.

*Patrick Kenzler* is an architect and interior designer. In his research he focusses on the design of spatial concepts for collaboration. Patrick Kenzler has conceptualized and designed several collaboration spaces such as for the HPI School of Design Thinking or the Humboldt Lab. In this project he will be involved in the needfinding, synthesis and ideation phase and is mainly responsible for the 3D-modeling of the first prototype as well as the furnishing and the fitting-out of the Living Lab.

*Previous projects or activities*

**Note that there are pictures visualising the projects and tools used available**

*Lufthansa Technik AG:* Spaces for collaboration Lufthansa Technik AG asked Dark Horse to research the existing working culture at Lufthansa Technik and to develop a spatial concept for collaboration based on these findings. Through observation, interviews and participatory workshops all 400 employees were involved in the analysis and conceptual phase. The main focus lied in identifying the opportunities for change whilst preserving other spatial concepts and processes that already worked well in the existing structure. Due to the research findings and developed concepts Dark Horse will be further involved in the planning of two new office floors. The interior design of these spaces will offer spatial qualities that enable the collaboration among the employees while at the same time giving space and infrastructure for individual work. Dark Horse will undertake a moderating and consulting role towards the employees in enabling them to use the new spaces and implementing a successful working culture.

*Deutsche Bahn AG:* Moving Ideas Deutsche Bahn AG is one of the largest transport companies in the world. All suppliers and industrial partners form part of a huge network. The idea was to benefit from this hub of expertise and to turn it into a driver for innovation. Dark Horse got engaged to develop a virtual platform that facilitates the collaboration across all branches. Dark Horse developed a browser based platform on which projects can be launched, discussed and worked on. The platform offers users the possibility to get instant and multi-perspective feedback on the current stages of their project. In addition to that the platform serves as the link between the digital and analog world of each project.

*Out of the Box:* Whiteboard Working mainly in a physical space with post-it notes and whiteboards Dark Horse itself is in need for specific creativity tools. While existing whiteboards lacked flexibility and usability Dark Horse together with Room in a Box, a company specialized on cardboard furniture, developed a lightweight and user-friendly whiteboard. The board is built out of cardboard and is supplied with four movable disks. By analogy to the first digital data discs, these discs are writeable from both sides and serve as a digital store that can be carried around and taken to the next meeting.

*SAP AG:* Design Thinking & Scrum for innovative projects In 2012 the SAP AG started the initiative to implement the Design Thinking Methodology in their company. Dark Horse accompanied SAP Germany and SAP India for more than a year in applying the Design Thinking Methodology to the product development and to create innovative products. Different Scrum-Teams got trained and consulted by Dark Horse in Design Thinking and user-centered design throughout the conceptual and designing phase of their products. The awareness for the users’ need and the implementation of collaborative elements had a noticeable impact on the „innovativeness“ of the products.

*Audi AG:* Ideas Virus The Audi AG hired Dark Horse in order to find out about existing innovation hubs within their company. Through interviews and observation Dark Horse identified persons and departments that are key to the innovation processes and product development at Audi. Based on these findings the Audi AG launched a process that aims at designing a concept for collaboration among the employees and thus foster innovation. 


##### Weyeser

Delftechpark 26

*Weyeser* is a company specialized in supporting organizations to translate big amounts of data into knowledge by means of data mining, text mining and visualization. Their solutions offer Governments, Governmental Institutions, Universities, Think Tanks and Corporations ways of objectively assessing their knowledge portfolio and that of their peers.

Within this proposed project weyeser will provide expertise concerning the questions of how mere data processing can be transformed into a process of knowledge production. Not only cultural institutions, but organizations, institutions and companies of all fields produce and provide increasing sets of digital data. Weyeser will develop applications that allows humanities students to compile new perspectives and knowledge from the analysis, correlation and visualization of these data sets. At the same time these tools will make humanities research and concepts more tangible and accessible to an larger audience.

CastYourArt provides insights into the world of art. CastYourArt wants to discover, make accessible, transmit, support and entertain. In doing so we rely on content rather than superficiality, authenticity instead of glib professionalism, complexity instead of oversimplification, we rely on networking and exchange rather than on separation and of course we love what we do. 
 
Audio and video features produced by CastYourArt protrait artists, exhibitions, collectors, persons and institutions involved in the world of. It is all about ideas and thoughts, protagonists, networks and mechanisms, about experiments, theories and reflection, inspiration and emotions, about diversity as well as discrepancies. How are works of art created and which ideas motivated the artist? What motivates the collector - fascination, profit, love, addiction, calculation? How does a curator see his exhibition and how does the audience? We are interested in these and other questions. We want to hear frankly, see differently, be there, make available and tangible, be inspired, and be able to learn. Productions by CastYourArt want to express individuality and leave room for development of creative potential in the production process.  
 
CastYourArt produced about 250 video-portraits of artists and art-institutions within the last six years. This videos are published through the CastYourArt plattform (www.castyourart.com) as well as podcasting, wikipedia etc. In 2013 CastYourArt had about 1 million plays within its podcast-subscriptions and its website. Additionally to its online activities CastYourArt is also busy offline.   

CastYourArts services include advice, production and distribution of audio and film features, creation and editing of textual content, online and offline distribution of the features, exhibition activities, project development and organisation in the domain of art, and artist management as well as liaising between art and business. We call art to people’s attention. We offer the infrastructure to show what exhibition halls, museums, galleries, collectors and art-oriented companies offer for art-interested people.
