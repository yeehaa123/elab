###1. Excellence 

*Your proposal must address a topic set out in the work programme, for this call for proposals. This section of your proposal will be assessed only to the extent that it is relevant to that topic.*


####1.1 Objectives 
*Describe the specific objectives for the project, which should be clear, measurable, realistic and achievable within the duration of the project. Objectives should be consistent with the expected exploitation and impact of the project (see section 2).* 

The project is about exploring the digital tools we use and how we use them. The overarching goal is to integrate technology into the humanities and to integrate the humanities into technology. We aim to elevate the processes of tool building to the status of research in the humanities. Engaging these traditionally less-technical students and scholars with technology empowers them to proactively develop their own tools, as well as to more deeply reflect on their use of these tools. Once comfortable doing that, they can collaborate with others within academia and with business and cultural instutitions to make technological innovations that impact a wider audience. Encouraging technology within this faculty makes a concrete step towards evaporating the mindset that separates a male majority and male-dominated world of technology from a female-majority world of humanities.

We seek to extend our activities to creating a coding platform, a lab, and a major exhibition. All three will explore their relationship to interfaces. The platform (Platform for Interface) is an online forum with an offline component that 




To enrich these courses and enhance the analysis of the coding platform's processes and results, we seek funding from other sources to offer two PhD positions related to relationships between humanities and technology. These positions would be excellent additions to the project, but the main focus of the project is to create new products and services and support research and development activities. Each project will address a key aspect of the overall objective to foster connections between technology and humanities. 

The first project will address the Physical Lab element, and will involve a PhD student working part-time as an embedded researcher in a separate institution. The project will investigate sustainable forms of knowledge transfer and creative and collaborative work practices in combined digital and physical learning environments.

The second project will relate to the core project of the coding platform. The PhD student will research how to reflect on tools through coding. S/he will conceptualize, plan, monitor, and program the coding platform. This PhD will serve as a way of measuing the development and success of the platform over four years. This researcher will be well integrated into the context of the university's department of digital humanities, and will also collaborate with private and public partners.
 
That is the second element of this project: applying a humanities perspective to practical applications outside academia in a physical lab. These include partnerships with museums and companies that aim to innovate new forms of technology with direct impact from the humanities. CtH collaborates with private and public partners, such as universities, museums, and companies that help to explore new forms of academic teaching and self-learning on the one hand and provide a prcatical demand on the other hand. This creates space for creative thinking and concept development through embedded researchers. Humanities students and scholars will work in musuems and in entrepreneurial environments to apply their methods of thinking to practical applications. This approach is in line with the increasing ... for motivation to collaborate with private partners via embedded research. An example of this is Johanna Biernbeck's work as an embedded researcher at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, where she explores new ways to activate unused space and time in the museum. This research project aims at creating a theoretical framework, formulating existing and desired features, testing user experience, developing prototypes of new interfaces for virtual and physical interaction in the museum context.

Measuring results:
The most basic measurement of the expansion of technology within the humanities faculty will be inclusion—how many people learn coding and provide portfolio projects. These can be measured by the pilot website. They can also be measured by offline events, such as workshops (e.g. the coding sessions), hackathons, and information events (data drive) that initiate debate and whose outcomes (in the first two cases) could be traced online in form of coding projects.  Students’ improved skillsets can be measured by first developing an online questionaire to find out which technical devices humanities students already possess, which kind of programs they use in general, which kind of programs for their research and which programming languages they use. From that base, we can measure their newly gained knowledge by what they create with coding. Students will be required to record their findings as they go, and to share them with each other. From there, students can experiment with each others' findings. 

Successes from collaborations with human design companies and museums can be measured first by the number of partnerships that take place. Then, the output of those partnerships can serve as a measurement of success as well, first of all in the new software and modifications that they create. This can be categorized into tools that they create or modify for their own use and tools that can be used by a wider audience. 
Additionally, output can be publications on subjects such as new forms of education and teaching, the combination of online and offline learning strategies, and how to make the humanities more attractive for collaborations with private partners. We will encourage peer organization and evaluation; students will also contribute to creating methods of evaluating their work.

The objective is realistic and achievable because it both addresses a timely demand and because the technology has become more accessible and thereby enables a much wider group to code.








1.2 Relation to the Work Programme

*Indicate the work programme topic to which your proposal relates, and explain how your proposal addresses the specific challenge and scope of that topic, as set out in the work programme.* 


The project proposed fits the work programm  "Platform for ICT for Learning and Inclusion" as it seeks to initiate a dialogue between university scholars and students, knowledge institutions and private companies about the potential merits of ICT for new forms of teaching, learning, knowledge production and transfer.  

For this reason the consortium will conceptualize and develop an online platform accompanied by an offline space that allow humanities students to acquire coding skills by learning by themselves and in peer groups or in offline workshops and events. This training will empower the students to understand, use and shape their digital tools. It also affords a space for collaboration and exchange. 

The members of the consortium combine a broad expertise that allows to explore how ICT can enhance humanities research and education, how these insights can help knowledge institutions to make their heritage more accessible and understandable for a larger public and how these knowledge can inspire SMEs for the development of new products.

While the focus lies on humanities stundents in the first place, the students are trained to train each other instead of merely providing them with guidance abd support in the use of prefabricated tools. The emphasis on openess and accessibility in the choice of the platforms architecture adds to this approach as it encourages the students to pass on their knowledge to peers and share the outcome of their projects. Open licenses allow other students, universities or knowledge institutions to benefit from the knowledge, code and tools accumulated on the platform. These rescources invite others to share, re-use, adapt and to form collaborations based on code.  

The platform hence reaches out to other universities, knowledge institutions and private partners alike in order to initiate a dialoge about new forms of education that not only integrate ICT but empower a large number of people to use and shape these technologies to their specific needs. Due to the open licenses used the digital tools developed by the students can be applied and altered also by social institutions, civic movements or the general public.  

There is a current demand for finding news ways to share resources in the software development community; humanities people are eager to increase their marketability and this is a concrete way to do so. Introducing coding as a natural part of the humanities curriculum will steer humanities students, typically non-technically biased, towards finding it natural to explore and shape new technology in their research. This is significant to all humanities students involved, and will automatically reach a large number of women because humanities students are disproportionately female. An EU study from October 2013 shows that there are still very few girls graduating from ICT programs and the same is true for women working in ICT. The same study claims that more women working in ICT would bring €9 billion annual GDP boost in the digital sector. This project would diminish the trend for women to avoid ICT not by identifying women as a target group or by making ICT appear appealing to women in particular, but by focusing on offering technology to all those who are non-technically biased. Other institutions, such as museums and companies, can also greatly benefit from those in the humanities. Providing a coding platform will link humanities students and researchers to the outside world in tangible ways, and will at the same time allow them to extend their deep thinking to the topic of technology, and more generally to the tools they use rather than the resulting knowledge they obtain.

CtH therefore aims to sensitize humanities students and others for the importance of an understanding of ICT that goes beyond a mere users knowledge. Students, institutions, companies and civic organizations should discuss and grasp the opportunities these technologies provide and the impact they have on their everyday life, in order to form an informed community with an sustainable interested in altering and shaping these tools. An educational platfrom dealing with coding is a first effort in that respect.  


####1.3 Concept and approach, quality of the coordination and support measures

*Describe and explain the overall concept underpinning the project. Describe the main ideas, models or assumptions involved;* 
Connecting humanities to technology unlocks potential for holistic approaches to innovation, including those that consider ethical/moral impacts of technology and its use, ...

Many humanities students and scholars are reluctant to learn new technologies, and thereby limit both their own ability to influence the outside world, as well as the incorporation of technology in their research. As Mitch Resnick has said, not being able to take charge of the technological tools we use to meet our own particular needs is similar to being able only to read a language but not write. For full use of the language and to use it to express ourselves, we must also be able to use it to create new structures. To make full use of technologies, we must be able not just to use them passively, but to modify them. This venture will empower humanities students and scholars to proactively drive their own learning and research. When they engage with technology through coding, they open the doors to master and innovate their own tools.

For the platform, users make a profile on GitHub, an online public platform for maintaining and sharing repositories that has distributed version control (each user has access to all versions of all documents in the project and can modify existing projects). Their profiles contain all their work, every single contribution to their repositories, which encourages sharing and reuse but also provides them with a portfolio which shows their skills. This portfolio increases the employability of humanities students in addition to serving as a documentation site. 

The platform is developed in JavaScript, which will also be the main programming language that is used on the platform. JavaScript is the language that is used on most websites and in all modern web browsers to let the user interact with the web. The advantage of using JavaScript is that it gives users access to the full stack of technologies: client-side, server-side and database levels can be controlled with JavaScript. With it, programmers can interact with data on any website and any web platform. JavaScript also combines the major programming paradigms, so users switching to other programming languages will recognise many elements and don't need to start from scratch.

Developments in programming languages have shifted the focus from computation to language. Commands in modern programming languages are more like natural language expressions, whereas older languages forced programmers to formulate very algebraic commands. This makes modern languages more intuitive to use, which lowers the threshold and together with the vast number of interesting JavaScript modules available on the web, even novice programmers can build interesting applications in a matter of hours or days instead of months or years. Promoting programming skills to a large audience makes more sense now than ever before. 

We will develop an online learning platform which is complemented by an according offline space. This approach avoids the mere transfer of offline teaching methods into the online world, which is a typical weakness of many Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), but explores what offline collaboration can be informed by strategies applied with online tools and how innovative offline practices can initiate and foster online cooperation. It seeks to provide students with the technological foundations to acquire and develop these skills by themselves and in peer learning based processes, based on tutorials and assigments. 

The platform will embrace open source culture and open licenses. The students share their code projects on a distributed repository which encourages re-use, altering and further development. This platform is therefore open, inclusive and sustainable.

 It encourages a shift from relying on often inappropriate tools to personally creating tools specific to their particular needs, as well as a shift from isolated work at a desk to collaborative and practical work with others, even extending possibilities for collaborations to outside academia.
 
 All interaction with the platform is done via the web browser. All modern browsers allow users to directly interact with web sites and servers through the browser console using JavaScript. Thereby users can directly apply their coding skills to anything they encounter on the web. Another advantage is that this minimises the threshold to developing and using programmings skills, as web browsers are found on most computers and are provided by default with all popular operating systems. At the same time, using JavaScript in the browser exposes users to the full range of programming possibilities.

The platform is tool oriented. Students develop small tools and widgets that perform small parts of the research they want to conduct. The reason to focus on tools is that researchers in general and humanities scholars in particular need to reflect critically on the tools they use for their research. By becoming proficient at conceptualising and developing tools, scholars develop a keen eye for perceiving how digital tools work in general. 

The coding platform will build upon Coding the Humanities, an already strong research project at the University of Amsterdam that has been successfully running for more than a year. Coding the Humanities is closely linked to several other projects, including zooniverse, dh, chat, and circa, and explores interplay between humanities and technology within the humanities faculty. It currently introduces programming to humanities students through coursework. We have three courses that are incorporated into the curriculum on programming basics. The course "Art, Science, and Technology" is running now, and the courses "Coding the Humanities" and "From Objected Data" will both begin in September 2014. Increasing the number of humanities students and scholars with programming skills through this coding platform will allow them to shape and create digital tools that meet their particular research needs and encourage new forms of learning, teaching and knowledge production. This skillset will sensitize the participants to their technological environment and make them aware of the challenges and opportunities ICT offers for humanities research. Coding knowledge makes those in the humanities more employable because humanities students and scholars will increasingly need to be able to read and write code. Expanding the context beyond the classroom to the coding platform will give students a venue to connect and share with participants outside the university.


models:

assumptions involved: 
- assumption that academia and the rest of the world are separate and cannot interact, and the idea that they can work together. More specifically, the idea that humanities students and scholars are separated from technology, and the goal of engaging them with it.

- universities face a loss of authority as models of traditional education being replicated in online formats, and the goal of creating new tools in the context of today’s increasingly interdependent world

- transfering the classroom into online formats does no justice to the possibilities provided by online tools in terms of peer learning, collaboration, exchange that abandons the dichotomy of experts and layman

- We thus work from a model that favors collaboration over ownership. Rather than competing against one another, we seek to create environments and promote tools that encourage equality in teamwork.

- Our model favors training rather than support, with the perspective that empowering people to take charge of the tools they use is better than simply assisting them. Also related to the goal of increasing the number of people who know how their tools function, our model emphasises accessible tools over state of the art tools. Accessibility is condusive to a wider group of users and makers, while state of the art tools discourage those who do not consider themselves to be tech-savy.

- We also favor knowledge production over data processing...

##### Approach

This research proposal consists of four integrated research areas in which public-private-civic partnerships (quad-helix) lead to a sharing of expertise and collaborative practices geared at the development of a cutting-edge innovative educational ecosystem that is specific to the (digital) humanities. These research areas are socio-technical in their approach; apart from combining insights from different partners to develop technological solutions (such as an online educational platform), valorize existing and new R&D methodologies (such as design thinking methodologies and embedded research practices) and the translation of data streams and information in intuitive interfaces that make use of visualization, this research proposal seeks to specially gear technological developments and efforts to enhance society by closing the digital divide. By collaborating throughout the project with public, private and civic partners, the project foresees the accumulation of knowledge and a digital skilling of particular hitherto unreached civic groups. 

These efforts should be viewed in line with two overarching developments in contemporary society and in humanities’ research; the move to create smart cities where citizens are digitally empowered and the development of digital humanities. By integrating the digital skilling of citizens with the agenda of the development of digital humanities, the project aims to perform academic research through a digital inclusion methodology/practice. Practically, the envisioned educational platform realizes local engagement, user-focused learning with both an individually-oriented as well as collective component; collaboration and the accumulation of knowledge and skills are key to a successful implementation of the platform. 
Each of the four research areas anticipates and addresses an upcoming challenge. 

##### 1. Platform for Learning an Research

Universities are challenged in their ways of distributing knowledge by an increasing number of massive open online courses (MOOC) and try to follow suit by providing the same techniques to their students. However, this approach transfers the classroom scheme into the online world but fotrifies dichotomies of expert and layman, teacher and student. At the same time, within the classroom scheme MOOCs address big numbers, which goes along with the decrease of education. 


##### 2. Spaces for Embedded Research 

Universities are open up towards other universities, civic movements and companies, so that other groups can benefit from their knowledge.

This process of opening up can be accelerated by spaces that are situated in between. The living labs show how this can lead to innovation. Spaces for spaces for embedded research a place for overlapping , theory and artistic practice , physical and digital research , of studio, workshop, library , of institutions - private and public , an independent place outside the department structure of the university , a room that enables, allows to experiment

Embedded researcher is a new and exiting role within the university. Its goal is to establish sustainable partnerships between private partners and universities. In practice, however, this turns out to be 
problematic, since the role and position of this kind of researcher is peripheral by definition. The embedded research usual works on short term projects and inbetween the academy and a company. 


##### 3. Numbers / Interfaces

Academia is increasingly confronted with large amounts of data. In order to turn this data into information and into knowledge, researchers and students need tools that allow to structure, search, correlate, analyze but most importantly present and visualize this data. This is also true for working fields related to the humanities: museums, libraries and archives are challenged to make the huge data sets that result from digitalization of the cultural heritage they foster //opencultuur.nl//, accessible and understandable for as many people as possible. Despite the opportunities these  mass resources generated in numerous digitization projects provide, humanities researchers and students are reluctant to exploit these troves.

//"While digital resources are becoming more visible in the humanities, use of these resources by scholars remains limited. … Digitization projects are bringing texts, data sources, sound, and images to the scholar’s desktop; however, the functions on which research in the humanities depend are neither well understood nor well supported by librarians."// (Brockman et al, 2001) / Bradley Text

Also municipalities and governments increasingly share their data openly online. The skills to compile graspable information out of big data sets becomes more important on the level of politics and social agency. It allows civic movements but also single citizens to understand political and social processes, identify problems and develop solutions – that can be software based. //gelt project // white house data // open knowledge foundation//. 

Visualizations like cartography, timelines, graphs, diagrams or animations, but also the design of interactive interfaces, thus help to translate data into knowledge by providing a context for different information and a combination of different data sets. This approach can boost humanities research and at the same time it makes humanities concepts and research productive and understandable for a broader audience as the visual translation of the data can inspire the mind to new insights. 

Coding the Humanities trains students to read and handle data streams and shows possible ways to translate these into visualizations. The programming language the students are encouraged to learn first, JavaScript, holds a low threshold for the practical application of code in various fields, visualization being one of them. 
The students apply the knowledge gained early on by exploring existing JavaScript libraries such as Data Driven Documents [http://d3js.org/](http://d3js.org/). This open source code collection allows the students to understand the translation of data into visualization but also empowers them to pursue little projects from which they can gain new perspectives on the data relevant to their research. These tools enhance the analysis and understanding of complex relations and concepts relevant to humanities research. At the same time data sets become comprehensible and presentable to a broader audience. 

The developed tools can be applied to different data sets. Especially with regard to the above mentioned open data sets provided by more and more cultural institutions and organizations, data visualization tools provide a great foundation for collaborative activities between universities and other institutions. These tools allow to exceed the mode of mere data processing to the actual production of new insights and knowledge.

In this research field we will therefore combines private partners with expertise in the field of visualization and interfaces but also in the production of videos and audios. These private partners will be complemented by museums which, with datasets related to their collections, can provide a real setting in which the knowledge can be applied.

**Consortium** 

In this research field we work with the Dutch company weyeser with its expertise in supporting organizations to translate big amounts of data into knowledge by means of data mining, text mining and visualization. So far their solutions offer governments, governmental institutions, universities, think tanks and corporations ways of objectively assessing their knowledge portfolio and that of their peers. Within the framework of CtH weyeser will support humanities students in the analysis and visualization of the humanities related data sets relevant to their research.

Weyesers expertise with visialisations and interfaces is accompanied by Austrian company CastYourArt which is focused on consulting, production and online/offline distribution of audio and video material in which they present artists, exhibitions and collectors and take art out of the museum context.

The public partners inviolved are the Royal Tropical Institute, a research institut with five Dutch museums attached  and Europeana, the network of european libraries, archives and other cultural institutions. 


//We would love to initiate a collaboration between you and the private/public partners that allows Coding the Humanities researchers and students to explore new formats to make data and information related to museum collections accessible and experienceable. With regard to the private partners these explorations could involve the conception and development of visualizations in general terms, as video or audio and/or in form of interfaces.// 

//In a series of workshops the students/researchers should learn about the status quo of visualization within the museums context. Their humanities background then allows them to comprehend how to turn data into a narrative and thus develop perspectives on how address visitors in new ways. With their coding skills and the support of the private partner, the students will collectively conceptualize and develop software solutions for field but not limited to this field.//

//Europeana would provide us with API access, advice and critique from an institutionalised repository, and participate in joint meetings and publications. In terms of budget we should make sure they get a travel budget (€2,000 per year?), and some time (for participation and contributions). We will need to check with Jill to see if that is ok and how much they need for time, but I would guess that about €10-15K per year would be more than enough.//


Moreover, the consortium in this research field will be completed by a public partner, the Tropenmuseum Amsterdam, which will initiate projects that encourage students to work with the datasets related to their collection. In a series of workshops with the private and the public partner the students will learn about the status quo of visualization within the museums context. With their humanities background the students are predestined to comprehend how to turn data into a narrative and how to meet the demands of the visitor. With their coding skills and the support of the private partner, the students will collective conceptualize and develop software solutions for this field but not limited to this field. The outcome of this project will be accessible and free to use by other students, scholars, cultural institutions or civic movements.  

Visualization empowers the students to make the increasing number of large datasets productive for their research. The new perspectives gained also provide arguments and strategies for a larger audience ranging from museums to foundations to civic movements.

### Interfaces: Governing the Platform

As Chinn and Fairly have shown in their cross country analysis on digital divide (Chinn and Fairly, 2004) there are not only dramatic geographic differences in accessibility to and user skills of ICT but also socio-economic and demographic gaps. There is a large group of children, women, elderly and economically disadvantaged that are or face to be digitally excluded. 

With regard to the growing impact of ICT not only on economic productivity but also in all other fields, such as the cultural, social and political realm, this exclusion forms a serious thread to societies in terms of equality, inclusion and chances of participation. 

ICT is no longer restricted to tools that enhance communication. With continually increasing funding for the ambition to create smart cities and through integration of ICT into ever more objects of everyday life like watches, clothes, fridges - a situation coined with the term ??"internet of things"?? - accessibility and digital literacy determine whether a person is included into social and cultural life, is employable and, perhaps more importantly, whether they can participate in decision making processes within the democratic realm. In other words, using and comprehending ICT tools is about agency and inclusion. 

As evaluations of the project one laptop per child have shown (Christia et al, 2012), access to ICT does not guarantee an automatic improvement of skills, e.g. in the classical educational subjects like math or reading. Access needs to be accompanied by training and education that allows children and other potentially excluded groups to understand the utility and power of the digital tools they hold in their hands. This training needs to address the intrinsic curiosity that makes kids wonder how things work. Instead of providing kids and other non tech savy groups with digital tools running programs presumably suiting their needs, these groups need to be sensitized to wonder what a program is and how it can be altered, how a specific tool can be modified and adjusted to their specific needs and desires (which might not overlap with those of the tech elite).

This research field will therefore explore the crucial question on how the motivation of a diverse group of people that do not have an affinity for ICT can be addressed, so they understand the challenges and opportunities that ICT holds for their lives and provide them with an sustainable way to acquire an understanding of the technologies that goes beyond a mere knowledge of how to use the gadgets at hand. 
It seeks to deliver an answer to the question of how we can enable people of all ages and with various socio-economical backgrounds (CURRENT SITUATIONS?) to overcome the reluctance OR OBSTACLES? towards their technological surrounding and lower the threshold to engage and develop a sustainable interests in these gadgets. These interests should be driven by a practical motivation strong enough to encourage them to pass on the knowledge gained to others and pursue group based interest driven projects in which this knowledge is applied. 
ON SCOPE: I THINK THE FOCUS IS ON THOSE WHO DO HAVE THE OPTION TO ENGAGE WITH ICT BUT FEEL RELUCTANT TO DO SO. I KNOW THE PLATFORM WILL BE OPEN TO EVERYONE ALL OVER THE WORLD, BUT WHO SPECIFICALLY DO WE REALISICALLY EXPECT TO PARTICIPATE?

In this field the level of technical knowledge non tech savy people already have and the possibilities to motivate an engagement with ICT that goes beyond a mere user knowledge will be researched. Based on the tools provided on the learning platform and combined with information events and workshops at the lab space the possible application of coding knowledge to practical fields related to the everyday life of people will trigger their motivation to learn and teach each others in order to solve a concrete problem. In that sense an awareness of the powerful practical impact of coding skills and a better understanding of ICT (economically, socially, culturally, for education and knowledge production) have to be communicated. 

In order to make this tool oriented problem solving approach sustainable, it needs to foster and organize a community that is not only provided with an online peer learning environment but has to be accelerated by offline events at which problems to be solved can be negotiated, projects be started and most importantly, people can engage with technology as layman with the fear to fail.

The outcome will be a set of very practical tools, that address the needs of a wide audience and thus might also advance the interest of a wide audience in tech.

By avoiding the high theoretical threshold typical to academic ICT programs and focusing on the developments of tools that solve small everyday problems. 

ICT has to be related to the interest of students / people – they have to understand how the increasing dominance of ICT in all fields affects them and how they can make these tools productive form their interests.

Conservative computer science or programming programs start on such a high and abstract level, that does not allow people to relate it to their research interest or everyday life. 

- how coding enables them to understand their surroundings and can provide them with agency  

Humanities studies already seek to explore how tools affect us and change things. This project aims to extend that curiosity to digital tools. The coding platform communicates to humanities students in their language / approaches new technology from a humanities perspective, making it accessible to them to become open to coding. 

<!--- Marijn: the problem is well explained. Now how are we going to tackle this? A humanities interest in tools, i.e., how they affect us and change things, could be an interesting perspective to address motivation. The interest from a Mediastudies perspective probably speaks more to laymen than the interest from a computer science perspective. So a platform that explains tools from a media perspective but through code could be a better trigger than the boring and abstract computer science MOOCs on offer today. --->



*Describe any national or international research and innovation activities which will be linked with the project, especially where the outputs from these will feed into the project;*

*Describe and explain the overall approach, distinguishing, as appropriate, coordination and support activities;* 

* The overall approach to this project is to stimulate both self-empowerment and at the same time, collaboration, between those working in the humanities those outside academia. This will be done by offering PhD positions, encouraging embedded research activities, and working together with Human Design companies for fruitful interaction in the physical lab. There is already an extensive amount of coordination between the University of Amsterdam and outside institutions for this project. Productive meetings with several companies have taken place, including Dark Horse.  

*Where relevant, describe how sex and/or gender analysis is taken into account in the project’s content.*

This project is about empowering people to use technology, concentrating on those who are hesitant or face obstacles to do so. Girls and women overall face greater obstacles to accessing technology and education in general. Raising awareness of this issue, fostering discussion on feminism and coding, and working to create new ways of increasing the participation of girls and women in coding are all essential elements to our project.

previously unmet needs that can be met by bringing sex and gender into the research: addressing the roots of the divide between women and men in technology

equipping more girls and women with coding skills will enable them to create tools that they need, which have been overlooked in the male-dominated world of coding and technology in general. 

- The number of woman attracted by coding within CtH could be increased by collaborations with initiatives that seek to do the same - increase the number of female coders, like Railsgirls [http://railsgirls.com/](http://railsgirls.com/) or geekettes [http://www.geekettes.io/](http://www.geekettes.io/) in forms of workshops, information evenings in the lab.

A recent EU study shows that only 30% of the people in the ICT sector in Europe are women, a number that mirrors the low number of women with a degree in that field. [Digital Agenda: Bringing more women into EU digital sector would bring €9 billion annual GDP boost, EU study shows](http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-13-905_en.htm) While the same study shows the potential of having more woman working in that field traditional ICT programs fail to attract female students. At the same time female students in the humanities outnumber male students. Thus an approach like CtH holds enormous potential to engage more women in ICT via their research interests. The seminar *Coding the Humanities* at the university of amsterdam has shown that, in combination with tools relevant to their research, woman are as keen as men to engage with coding. 

*Sex and gender refer to biological characteristics and social/cultural factors respectively. For guidance on methods of sex / gender analysis and the issues to be taken into account, please refer to [http://ec.europa.eu/research/science-society/gendered-innovations/index_en.cfm](http://ec.europa.eu/research/science-society/gendered-innovations/index_en.cfm)*

//Horizon 2020 plays a central role in the delivery of the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth and acts as a vehicle for leveraging private investment, creating new job opportunities//
//The result will be an increased learning from experience, a boosted transferability of results and, as a consequence, an increased lasting effect of the supported activities.//

*Dissemination and exploitation measures should address the full range of potential users and uses including research, commercial, investment, social, environmental, policy making, setting standards, skills and educational training.* 

*The approach to innovation should be as comprehensive as possible, and must be tailored to the specific technical, market and organisational issues to be addressed.* 
 
*Explain how the proposed measures will help to achieve the expected impact of the project. Include a business plan where relevant;*

*Where relevant, include information on how the participants will manage the research data generated and/or collected during the project, in particular addressing the following issues:*

*What types of data will the project generate/collect?*

*What standards will be used?*

*How will this data be exploited and/or shared/made accessible for verification and re-use? If data cannot be made available, explain why.*

*How will this data be curated and preserved?*  

*You will need an appropriate consortium agreement to manage (amongst other things) the ownership and access to key knowledge (IPR, data etc.). These will allow you, collectively and individually, to pursue market opportunities arising from the project's results.*  

*Outline the strategy for knowledge management and protection. Include measures to provide open access (free on-line access such as the ‘green’ or ‘gold’ model) to peer-reviewed scientific publications which might result from the project.*

*Open access publishing (also called 'gold' open access) means that an article is immediately provided in open access mode by the scientific publisher. The associated costs are usually shifted away from readers, and instead (for example) to the university or research institute to which the researcher is affiliated, or to the funding agency supporting the research.* 

*Self-archiving (also called 'green' open access) means that the published article or the final peer-reviewed manuscript is archived by the researcher - or a representative - in an online repository before, after or alongside its publication. Access to this article is often - but not necessarily - delayed (‘embargo period’) as some scientific publishers may wish to recoup their investment by selling subscriptions and charging pay-per-download/view fees during an exclusivity period.*


**b) Communication activities**

###3. Implementation

####3.1	Work plan – Work packages, deliverables and milestones

*Please provide the following:*

*brief presentation of the overall structure of the work plan* 

The proposed project is structured into four research fields: 

1) an online platform for learning and research, that allows students to aqcuire coding skills and work collaboratively
2) a space for embedded research – an offline space that complements the online platform and provides an in-between environment for university and public and private partners
3) the exploration of the opportunities interfaces and visualization of data holds for knowledge production
4) research that aims at developing strategies for development and inclusion

These fields are going to be explored by phd students, embedded researchers and students in combination with public and private partners. Inspired by open source culture and software development practices the fields are going to be explored simulataneously so that insights from one of the fields can be applied tranfered early on to the other fields. 

*timing of the different work packages and their components (Gantt chart or similar)*
*detailed work description, i.e.:*
*a description of each work package (table 3.1a)*
*a list of work packages (table 3.1b);*
*a list of major deliverables (table 3.1c);*
*graphical presentation of the components showing how they inter-relate (Pert chart or similar)*

*Give full details. Base your account on the logical structure of the project and the stages in which it is to be carried out. Include details of the resources to be allocated to each work package. The number of work packages should be proportionate to the scale and complexity of the project.* 

*You should give enough detail in each work package to justify the proposed resources to be allocated and also quantified information so that progress can be monitored, including by the Commission.* 

*You are advised to include a distinct work package on ‘Management’ (see section 3.2), and to give due visibility in the work plan to ‘dissemination and exploitation’ and ‘communication activities’, either with distinct tasks, or possibly distinct work packages.* 

*You will be required to include an updated (or confirmed) plan for ‘dissemination and exploitation’ in both the mid-term and final reports. (This does not apply to topics where a draft plan was not required.) This should include a record of activities related to dissemination and exploitation that have been undertaken, and those still planned. A report of completed and planned communication activities will also be required.* 

*If your project is taking part in the Pilot on Open Research Data, you must include a 'data management plan' as a distinct deliverable within the first 6 months of the project. A template for such a plan is given in the guidelines on data management in the H2020 Online Manual. This deliverable will evolve during the lifetime of the project in order to present the status of the project's reflections on data management.*

**Definitions:**

**Work package** *means a major sub-division of the proposed project*

**Deliverable** *means a distinct output of the project, meaningful in terms of the project’s  overall objectives, and constituted by a report, a document, a technical diagram, a software etc.*

**‘Milestones’** *means control points in the project that help to chart progress. Milestones may correspond to the completion of a key deliverable, allowing the next phase of the work to begin. They may also be needed at intermediary points so that, if problems have arisen, corrective measures can be taken. A milestone may be a critical decision point in the project where, for example, the consortium must decide which of several technologies to adopt for further development.*

//Milestones//
//research about conceptualization of online learning environment **paper** "Requirements to online learning environment for humanities research", "The merits of open source development platforms and methodologies for Humanities Research" 
-'back end'
-- which features should be involved?
-- which features do exists as open (source) programs and platforms (how to integrate them)?
-- which features have to be developed from scratch or adjusted?

-'interface'
-- how should the interface be designed to integrate the needed features and platforms? (work with a media designer and UX-experts) 

//development and design of the platform// 

//enrollment to students// **paper** experience and evaluation of the students practical use of the platfrom
//further development of the platform, integration of the evaluation of student's experience//

//research on on- and offline cooperation// **paper** "The merit of collaboration via github for humanities research" 
//integartion of a physical space//    
//communication campaign: events, hackathons, presentations to trigger collaborations with other institutions, SMEs, integrate more students//



####3.2	Management structure and procedures 
 
*Describe the organisational structure and the decision-making (including a list of milestones (table 3.2a));*
- private partners can't take over -- connection made via workshops and meetings
- how do decisions get made given a resistance to hierarchy?
- git as a platform to collect ideas and share feedback

*Explain why the organisational structure and decision-making mechanisms are appropriate to the complexity and scale of the project;*

*Describe, where relevant, how effective innovation management will be addressed  in the management structure and work plan;*
- effective innovation management : a self-managed system

*Innovation management is a process which requires an understanding of both market and technical problems, with a goal of successfully implementing appropriate creative ideas. A new or improved product, service or process is its typical output. It also allows a consortium to respond to an external or internal opportunity.*

*Describe any critical risks, relating to project implementation, that the stated project’s objectives may not be achieved. Detail any risk mitigation measures. Please provide a table with critical risks identified and mitigating actions (table 3.2b).*
- dropout of courses
- lack of participation / low level of participation
coding the humanities offers ownership while also being online. students are themselves active in producing / developing the content 


####3.3	Consortium as a whole 

*The individual members of the consortium are described in a separate section 4. There is no need to repeat that information here.* 

*Describe the consortium. How will it match the project’s objectives? How do the members complement one another (and cover the value chain, where appropriate)? In what way does each of them contribute to the project? How will they be able to work effectively together?* 
- 

ANNA: LOOK INTO:
*If applicable, describe the industrial/commercial involvement in the project to ensure exploitation of the results and explain why this is consistent with and will help to achieve the specific measures which are proposed for exploitation of the results of the project (see section 2.3).* 

**Other countries:** *If one or more of the participants requesting EU funding is based in a country that is not automatically eligible for such funding (entities from Member States of the EU, from Associated Countries and from one of the countries in the exhaustive list included in General Annex A of the work programme General Annex A of the work programme are automatically eligible for EU funding), explain why the participation of the entity in question is essential to carrying out the project.*

#####Dark Horse GmbH & Co KG  
Ritterstraße 12 - 14  
Aufgang 4, Etage 3  
10969 Berlin  

*Lisa Zoth* has a background in political science and anthropology. She has conducted several projects in regard to the implementation of the Design Thinking Methodology and Culture into companies such as SAP or Deutsche Bahn. Her research focus lies on the design of organizational collaboration and implementing innovation processes into traditional structures. Lisa Zoth will in this project be mainly involved in the need finding, synthesis and ideation phase of the project and evaluating the collaboration processes among the embedded researchers.

*Patrick Kenzler* is an architect and interior designer. In his research he focusses on the design of spatial concepts for collaboration. Patrick Kenzler has conceptualized and designed several collaboration spaces such as for the HPI School of Design Thinking or the Humboldt Lab. In this project he will be involved in the needfinding, synthesis and ideation phase and is mainly responsible for the 3D-modeling of the first prototype as well as the furnishing and the fitting-out of the Living Lab.

*Dark Horse* is an innovation agency based in Berlin which creates user-centered products and services and helps clients to change their structures, processes and minds. Their work is based on Design Thinking principles and their own unusual working culture that simultaneously stresses ﬂexibility and connections. They design spatial, procedural and social conditions of collaboration in on- and offline settings. Guided by their participative design approach, they created spaces and working culture for collaboration in science and creative industry.

Within the proposed project Dark Horse is going to conduct research on and develop a conceptual framework and design for a physical space that accompanies and complements the online learning platform. Their user centered approach and the background in anthropology and interior design allows Lisa Zoth and Patrick Kenzler to understand and translate the requirements of such a space into a practical design concept and the according user culture. They will provide an answer to the crucial question of how online collaboration and innovative practice can be initiated, accelerated and fostered through an offline setting. Moreover their research will provide insights to the students’ needs that cannot be satisfied merely by the application of ICT but are better addressed with a combination of digital instruments and offline collaboration and training methods.

*Previous projects or activities*

**Note that there are pictures visualising the projects and tools used available**

*Lufthansa Technik AG:* Spaces for collaboration Lufthansa Technik AG asked Dark Horse to research the existing working culture at Lufthansa Technik and to develop a spatial concept for collaboration based on these findings. Through observation, interviews and participatory workshops all 400 employees were involved in the analysis and conceptual phase. The main focus lied in identifying the opportunities for change whilst preserving other spatial concepts and processes that already worked well in the existing structure. Due to the research findings and developed concepts Dark Horse will be further involved in the planning of two new office floors. The interior design of these spaces will offer spatial qualities that enable the collaboration among the employees while at the same time giving space and infrastructure for individual work. Dark Horse will undertake a moderating and consulting role towards the employees in enabling them to use the new spaces and implementing a successful working culture.

*Deutsche Bahn AG:* Moving Ideas Deutsche Bahn AG is one of the largest transport companies in the world. All suppliers and industrial partners form part of a huge network. The idea was to benefit from this hub of expertise and to turn it into a driver for innovation. Dark Horse got engaged to develop a virtual platform that facilitates the collaboration across all branches. Dark Horse developed a browser based platform on which projects can be launched, discussed and worked on. The platform offers users the possibility to get instant and multi-perspective feedback on the current stages of their project. In addition to that the platform serves as the link between the digital and analog world of each project.

*Out of the Box:* Whiteboard Working mainly in a physical space with post-it notes and whiteboards Dark Horse itself is in need for specific creativity tools. While existing whiteboards lacked flexibility and usability Dark Horse together with Room in a Box, a company specialized on cardboard furniture, developed a lightweight and user-friendly whiteboard. The board is built out of cardboard and is supplied with four movable disks. By analogy to the first digital data discs, these discs are writeable from both sides and serve as a digital store that can be carried around and taken to the next meeting.

*SAP AG:* Design Thinking & Scrum for innovative projects In 2012 the SAP AG started the initiative to implement the Design Thinking Methodology in their company. Dark Horse accompanied SAP Germany and SAP India for more than a year in applying the Design Thinking Methodology to the product development and to create innovative products. Different Scrum-Teams got trained and consulted by Dark Horse in Design Thinking and user-centered design throughout the conceptual and designing phase of their products. The awareness for the users’ need and the implementation of collaborative elements had a noticeable impact on the „innovativeness“ of the products.

*Audi AG:* Ideas Virus The Audi AG hired Dark Horse in order to find out about existing innovation hubs within their company. Through interviews and observation Dark Horse identified persons and departments that are key to the innovation processes and product development at Audi. Based on these findings the Audi AG launched a process that aims at designing a concept for collaboration among the employees and thus foster innovation. 


#####Weyeser

Alexandro Mancusi *(add CV or description of the profile and responsibilities in the project)*

Weyeser is a company specialized in supporting organizations to translate big amounts of data into knowledge by means of data mining, text mining and visualization. Their solutions offer Governments, Governmental Institutions, Universities, Think Tanks and Corporations ways of objectively assessing their knowledge portfolio and that of their peers.

Within this proposed project weyeser will provide expertise concerning the questions of how mere data processing can be transformed into a process of knowledge production. Not only cultural institutions, but organizations, institutions and companies of all fields produce and provide increasing sets of digital data. Weyeser will develop applications that allows humanities students to compile new perspectives and knowledge from the analysis, correlation and visualization of these data sets. At the same time these tools will make humanities research and concepts more tangible and accessible to an larger audience.
