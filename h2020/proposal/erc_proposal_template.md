##Table of Contents


###1. Excellence 

*Your proposal must address a topic set out in the work programme, for this call for proposals. This section of your proposal will be assessed only to the extent that it is relevant to that topic.*


####1.1 Objectives 
*Describe the specific objectives for the project, which should be clear, measurable, realistic and achievable within the duration of the project. Objectives should be consistent with the expected exploitation and impact of the project (see section 2).* 

arguments> numbers, inclusion, universities lose authority over education

Coding the Humanities addresses the fact that humanities research and education will increasingly depend on people who know programming language. The project seeks to increase the number of humanities students that have programming skills which allow them to shape and create digital tools that meet their particular research needs and encourage new forms of learning, teachning and knowledge production. This skillset will sensitize the students to their technological environment and make them aware of the challenges and opportunities ITC offers for humanities research. The goal is to elevate the processes of tool building to the status of research in the humanities; engaging humanities students and scholars with technology in order to empower them to proactively develop the tools they use and to collaborate with others within and outside academia will stimulate mutually beneficial cooperation between the humanities and other fields, and between academia and non-academia. 
   
This goal is pursued by the conception and development of an online learning platform which is complemented by an according offline space. This approach avoids the mere transfer of offline teaching methods into the online world, which is a typical weakness of many MOOCs, but explores what offline collaboration can be informed by startegies applied with online tools and how innovative offline practices can initiate and foster online cooperation.   

The online platform seeks to provide the students with the technological foundations to acquire and foster these skills by themselves and in peer learning based processes, based on tutorials and assigments. 

The platform will embrace open source culture and open licenses. The students share their code projects on a distributed repository which encourages re-use, altering and further development. This platform is therefore open, inclusive and sustainable.

CtH collaborates with private and public partners, like universities and museums, that help to explore new forms of academic teaching and self-learning on the one hand and provide a prcatical demand on the other hand. 

Students’ improved skillsets can be measured by what they create with coding, and successes from collaborations with human design companies can be measured by innovations that result from working together.

This is realistic and achievable because …


####1.2 Relation to the work programme 
*Indicate the work programme topic to which your proposal relates, and explain how your proposal addresses the specific challenge and scope of that topic, as set out in the work programme.* 

In the first place the platform envisioned will enable humanities students to understand and shape ICT. However, CtH intends to train humanities students instead of providing them with guidance and support in the use of prefabricated tools. The knowledge generated will therefore be passed on and distributed via the online platform but also in the form of offline workshops. CtH therefore wishes to exceed the boundaries of the humanities and the academic realm by also addressing and including other groups.   

The platform hence reaches out to other universities, knowledge institutions and private partners alike in order to initiate a dialoge about new forms of education that not only integrate ICT but empower a large number of people to use and shape these technologies to their specific needs. Due to the open licenses used the digital tools developed by the students can be applied and altered also by social institutions, civic movements or the general public.   

//Develop and maintain a sustainable platform engaging a large number of key actors,
stakeholders and communities of practices on how to improve co-creation and delivery of
digital tools, solutions and services for the modernization of education and training and for the
employability of young people, as well as for tackling the risk of digital exclusion, and
thereby socio-economic exclusion.
The platform should engage - and be open to all - practitioners and stakeholders wishing to
contribute to decision making processes, agree on objectives and priorities, share experiences,
policies and practices on the role ICT for better education and training, e-Inclusion and e-
Accessibility.
The Commission considers that proposals requesting a contribution from the EU of EUR 1
million would allow this specific challenge to be addressed appropriately. Nonetheless, this
does not preclude submission and selection of proposals requesting other amounts.
Expected impact: The action will generate awareness and impact on a wider participation in
decision making processes related to the uptake of technologies involved in education,
training and inclusion.//




####1.3 Concept and approach, quality of the coordination and support measures
*Describe and explain the overall concept underpinning the project. Describe the main ideas, models or assumptions involved;* 
Most humanities students and scholars know how to use some technologies, but are reluctant to learn new technologies. Not being able to take charge and tweak the technology to one’s own particular needs is similar to being able only to read a language but not write. For full use of the language, and to have it fit your own needs, you must also be able to write. To make full use of technologies, we must be able not just to use them passively, but to create and modify them.
Main ideas, models / assumptions involved: 
* assumption that academia and the rest of the world are separate and cannot interact, and the idea that they can work together. More specifically, the idea that humanities students and scholars are separated from technology, and the goal of engaging them with it.
* models of traditional education being replicated in online formats, and the goal of creating new tools in the context of today’s increasingly interdependent world


*Describe any national or international research and innovation activities which will be linked with the project, especially where the outputs from these will feed into the project;*
//CIRCA// //ADH// //http://www.lifeparticipation.org//

*Describe and explain the overall approach, distinguishing, as appropriate, coordination and support activities;* 
* The overall approach to this project is to stimulate both self-empowerment and at the same time, collaboration, between those working in the humanities those outside academia. This will be done by offering PhD positions, encouraging embedded research activities, and working together with Human Design companies for fruitful interaction.

*Where relevant, describe how sex and/or gender analysis is taken into account in the project’s content.*
* Empowering people to use technology, including those who are hesitant or face obstacles to do so, means that we have a specific focus on girls and women, as they often face greater obstacles to accessing technology and education in general.

*Sex and gender refer to biological characteristics and social/cultural factors respectively. For guidance on methods of sex / gender analysis and the issues to be taken into account, please refer to [http://ec.europa.eu/research/science-society/gendered-innovations/index_en.cfm](http://ec.europa.eu/research/science-society/gendered-innovations/index_en.cfm)*


###2. Impact 

####2.1 Expected impacts 

*Please be specific, and provide only information that applies to the proposal and its objectives. Wherever possible, use quantified indicators and targets.*

*Describe how your project will contribute to the expected impacts set out in the work programme, under the relevant topic;*

*Describe any barriers/obstacles, and any framework conditions (such as regulation and standards), that may determine whether and to what extent the expected impacts will be achieved. (This should not include any risk factors concerning implementation, as covered in section 3.2.)* 


####2.2 Measures to maximise impact

**a) Dissemination and exploitation of results** 

*Provide a draft ‘plan for disseminating and exploiting the project’s results’ (unless the work programme topic explicitly states that such a plan is not required). The plan, which should be proportionate to the scale of the project, should contain measures to be implemented both during and after the project;*  

//The result will be an increased learning from experience, a boosted transferability of results and, as a consequence, an increased lasting effect of the supported activities//
//Horizon 2020 plays a central role in the delivery of the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth and acts as a vehicle for leveraging private investment, creating new job opportunities//
//The result will be an increased learning from experience, a boosted transferability of results and, as a consequence, an increased lasting effect of the supported activities.//

*Dissemination and exploitation measures should address the full range of potential users and uses including research, commercial, investment, social, environmental, policy making, setting standards, skills and educational training.* 

*The approach to innovation should be as comprehensive as possible, and must be tailored to the specific technical, market and organisational issues to be addressed.* 
 
*Explain how the proposed measures will help to achieve the expected impact of the project. Include a business plan where relevant;*

*Where relevant, include information on how the participants will manage the research data generated and/or collected during the project, in particular addressing the following issues:*

*What types of data will the project generate/collect?*

*What standards will be used?*

*How will this data be exploited and/or shared/made accessible for verification and re-use? If data cannot be made available, explain why.*

*How will this data be curated and preserved?*  

*You will need an appropriate consortium agreement to manage (amongst other things) the ownership and access to key knowledge (IPR, data etc.). These will allow you, collectively and individually, to pursue market opportunities arising from the project's results.*  

*Outline the strategy for knowledge management and protection. Include measures to provide open access (free on-line access such as the ‘green’ or ‘gold’ model) to peer-reviewed scientific publications which might result from the project.*

*Open access publishing (also called 'gold' open access) means that an article is immediately provided in open access mode by the scientific publisher. The associated costs are usually shifted away from readers, and instead (for example) to the university or research institute to which the researcher is affiliated, or to the funding agency supporting the research.* 

*Self-archiving (also called 'green' open access) means that the published article or the final peer-reviewed manuscript is archived by the researcher - or a representative - in an online repository before, after or alongside its publication. Access to this article is often - but not necessarily - delayed (‘embargo period’) as some scientific publishers may wish to recoup their investment by selling subscriptions and charging pay-per-download/view fees during an exclusivity period.*


**b) Communication activities**

Describe the proposed communication measures for promoting the project and its findings during the period of the grant. Measures should be proportionate to the scale of the project, with clear objectives.  They should be tailored to the needs of various audiences, including groups beyond the project’s own community. Where relevant, include measures for public/societal engagement on issues related to the project. 


###3. Implementation

####3.1	Work plan – Work packages, deliverables and milestones

*Please provide the following:*

*brief presentation of the overall structure of the work plan* 
*timing of the different work packages and their components (Gantt chart or similar)*
*detailed work description, i.e.:*
*a description of each work package (table 3.1a)*
*a list of work packages (table 3.1b);*
*a list of major deliverables (table 3.1c);*
*graphical presentation of the components showing how they inter-relate (Pert chart or similar)*

*Give full details. Base your account on the logical structure of the project and the stages in which it is to be carried out. Include details of the resources to be allocated to each work package. The number of work packages should be proportionate to the scale and complexity of the project.* 

*You should give enough detail in each work package to justify the proposed resources to be allocated and also quantified information so that progress can be monitored, including by the Commission.* 

*You are advised to include a distinct work package on ‘Management’ (see section 3.2), and to give due visibility in the work plan to ‘dissemination and exploitation’ and ‘communication activities’, either with distinct tasks, or possibly distinct work packages.* 

*You will be required to include an updated (or confirmed) plan for ‘dissemination and exploitation’ in both the mid-term and final reports. (This does not apply to topics where a draft plan was not required.) This should include a record of activities related to dissemination and exploitation that have been undertaken, and those still planned. A report of completed and planned communication activities will also be required.* 

*If your project is taking part in the Pilot on Open Research Data, you must include a 'data management plan' as a distinct deliverable within the first 6 months of the project. A template for such a plan is given in the guidelines on data management in the H2020 Online Manual. This deliverable will evolve during the lifetime of the project in order to present the status of the project's reflections on data management.*

**Definitions:**

**Work package** *means a major sub-division of the proposed project*

**Deliverable** *means a distinct output of the project, meaningful in terms of the project’s  overall objectives, and constituted by a report, a document, a technical diagram, a software etc.*

**‘Milestones’** *means control points in the project that help to chart progress. Milestones may correspond to the completion of a key deliverable, allowing the next phase of the work to begin. They may also be needed at intermediary points so that, if problems have arisen, corrective measures can be taken. A milestone may be a critical decision point in the project where, for example, the consortium must decide which of several technologies to adopt for further development.*

//Milestones//
//research about conceptualization of online learning environment **paper** "Requirements to online learning environment for humanities research", "The merits of open source development platforms and methodologies for Humanities Research" 
-'back end'
-- which features should be involved?
-- which features do exists as open (source) programs and platforms (how to integrate them)?
-- which features have to be developed from scratch or adjusted?

-'interface'
-- how should the interface be designed to integrate the needed features and platforms? (work with a media designer and UX-experts) 

//development and design of the platform// 

//enrollment to students// **paper** experience and evaluation of the students practical use of the platfrom
//further development of the platform, integration of the evaluation of student's experience//

//research on on- and offline cooperation// **paper** "The merit of collaboration via github for humanities research" 
//integartion of a physical space//    
//communication campaign: events, hackathons, presentations to trigger collaborations with other institutions, SMEs, integrate more students//



####3.2	Management structure and procedures 
 
*Describe the organisational structure and the decision-making (including a list of milestones (table 3.2a));*

*Explain why the organisational structure and decision-making mechanisms are appropriate to the complexity and scale of the project;*

*Describe, where relevant, how effective innovation management will be addressed  in the management structure and work plan;*

*Innovation management is a process which requires an understanding of both market and technical problems, with a goal of successfully implementing appropriate creative ideas. A new or improved product, service or process is its typical output. It also allows a consortium to respond to an external or internal opportunity.*

*Describe any critical risks, relating to project implementation, that the stated project’s objectives may not be achieved. Detail any risk mitigation measures. Please provide a table with critical risks identified and mitigating actions (table 3.2b).*



####3.3	Consortium as a whole 

*The individual members of the consortium are described in a separate section 4. There is no need to repeat that information here.* 

*Describe the consortium. How will it match the project’s objectives? How do the members complement one another (and cover the value chain, where appropriate)? In what way does each of them contribute to the project? How will they be able to work effectively together?* 

*If applicable, describe the industrial/commercial involvement in the project to ensure exploitation of the results and explain why this is consistent with and will help to achieve the specific measures which are proposed for exploitation of the results of the project (see section 2.3).* 

**Other countries:** *If one or more of the participants requesting EU funding is based in a country that is not automatically eligible for such funding (entities from Member States of the EU, from Associated Countries and from one of the countries in the exhaustive list included in General Annex A of the work programme General Annex A of the work programme are automatically eligible for EU funding), explain why the participation of the entity in question is essential to carrying out the project.*

Dark Horse is an innovation agency based in Berlin which creates user-centered products and services and helps clients 
to change their structures, processes and minds. Their work is based on Design Thinking principles and their own unusual working culture that simultaneously stresses ﬂexibility and connections. They design spatial, procedural and social 
conditions of collaboration in on and offline settings. Guided by their participative design approach, they created spaces and working culture for collaboration in science and creative industry. 		

Within the proposed project Dark Horse is going to conduct research on and develop of a conceptual framework and design of a physical space that accompanies and complements the online learning platform. Their user centered approach and the background in anthropology and interior designe allows Lisa Zoth and Patrick Kenzler to understand and translate the requirements of such a space into a practical design concept and the according user culture. They will provide an answer to the crucial question of how online collaboration and innovative pratice can be initiated, accelerated and fostered through an offline setting. Moreover their research will give insights to the students needs that cannot be satisfied merely by the application of ICT but are better addressed with a combination of digital instruments and offline collaboration and training methods.
