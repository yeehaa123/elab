## Collection as Interface

Deliverables:

+ 4.1 Interfaces exhibition Vienna
+ 	- deliverable 1: making a film of the exhibition
+ 	- deliverable 2: kickoff 2 day workshop in Amsterdam that includes our private partners and students. 
+ 	- deliverable 3: contribute to making a course work together with UvA students on the topic of ICT interfaces
+ 	- data drive thing
+ 	- assisting students to develop videos
+ 	- project-oriented, make students work 
	- creating new formats (that broaden the audience?) for video 
	- integrating video into ITC, providing a different context with a new frame. 
	- museums already try to reach a wider audience via video online
	- want students to find new ways to present data
	- explore the video as interface between institutions and audience
	- reaching new audiences ,lead to other technology in museums
+ 4.2 Open Source Library for Visualizing Humanities Research

+ 4.3 Repository with museum related projects open to use and develop further



Milestones:

+ kick-off workshop private and public partners (introduction the CtH platform as foundation for the project)

+ presentation / workshop for students / researchers Europeana representatives
"Engaging audiences - Interfaces and Visualizations in the museum context"

+ presentation / workshop for students weyeser "Visualization as means of inclusion"

+ presentation / workshop CastYourArt "Video and audio in the museum context"

+ formation of project groups mentored by private partners

+ first presentation of the projects / particpants feedback on collaborative working on the platform / the lab

+ evaluation / report "Online / offline Inclusion"

+ final presentation of projects 

+ evaluation / "Including Interfaces"

+ coming out: cultural hackathon event inviting the general public to work with the student proposals and the museum datasets
