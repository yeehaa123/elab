## Older bullets with some thoughts

+ course projects with online collections (government and heritage collections) will increase academic usage of those collections.

+ the platform as an interface to ICT reaches out to humanities researchers, heritage institutions, civic organisations and media professionals and will increase the number of non-technologically-biased people making, changing, using and feeling confident with digital tools.

+ We will organise workshops for various audiences. We will continue to organise hands-on workshops on programming and collaboration for humanities researchers and the Coding Sessions, which are open to anyone and are organised for people with an interest in ICT and with different levels of programming skills.

+ the exhibition will be promoted among both communities of open source developers, scholars working in digital humanities, as well as non-professionals with a desire to develop their understanding of ICT through their interest in and/or connecting with the topic of the exhibition.

+ through the open, online courses on the platform and the presentation of the project through workshops at academic events and at universities world wide, more universities will be motivated to employ the platform and courses as new and low-cost means to enhance their curriculums.

+ we will use exemplary projects made on the platform to convince other knowledge institutions to incorporate the platform as a way to encourage new forms of collaboration amongs their students and staff members and with other institutions internationally.
