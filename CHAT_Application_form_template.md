*These projects will be reviewed by the SoW Working Group for their suitability for inclusion within CHAT. The main criteria for inclusion are academic excellence, contribution to realizing the objectives of the White Paper, and the coherence of the program.*
*New researchers appointed to work on these projects will be expected to spend the majority of their time at the CHAT location (still to be determined). Senior staff engaged in the projects who are already employed by one of the CHAT partners will be expected to participate in meetings and other events held at the CHAT location.*
