# Minutes hangouts meeting 19.03.2014
Attendees: Marijn, Johanna, Filip and Thomas (minutes)

## KIEM 

main applicants
- Jan Hein, Marijn and Sabrina can be main applicants for KIEM proposals, so it should not be a problem to submit several proposals even in the same CLICKNL-networks
- since Jan Hein has initiated the Augmented Masterpieces project, it seems reasonable that he becomes the main applicant for Johanna's and Filip's proposal
- Thomas is going to talk Sabrina later on about BMC as a private partner and

### dividing tasks 
- the proposal blocks and according responsibilities were identified
- the proposals should be filled in by Johanna/Filip and Thomas and then send around via email
- Jan Hein and Marijn or Sabrina should submit a paragraph with their expertise
- concerning the project budget and time plan Jan Hein and Marijn should be asked
- they have to talk to the research department and let them know which project proposals will be submitted covering which time span
- the external partner has to submit his field of expertise, his way of contribution, the letter stating the budged he is willing to bring in

### Johanna and Filip
- will involve Lively
- Johanna is in touch with Peter from Lively and is going to connect him to Filip
- they are going to set up a meeting about the possible cooperation, especially about the private partner constellation between Flip and Lively 

### Thomas
- is going to talk to Sabrina about BMC this afternoon
- finds private parters himself 

### roadblocks 
- we have to figure out, how the main applicant can use the money, e.g. how we can bypass the following conditions (from the KIEM FAQs):

Wat zijn de regels voor besteding van het budget?
"De werkzaamheden voor het project kunnen niet uitbesteed worden aan een junioronderzoeker of student-assistent."

Waarvoor kan de vervangingssubsidie worden ingezet?
De financiering van NWO kan niet worden ingezet om ander personeel bij de instelling of bij de partner
aan te stellen. 

### Example proposals 
- Marijn is going to send an e-mail to some colleagues who are also working on am KIEM proposal
- Marijn is going to look for an old KIEM proposal and will send it around if he can find it
- Johanna is going to send around the Augmented Masterpieces proposal
- an alternative or extending route could be the Embedded Research funding scheme (Deadline July 10)
 
## Pitch
 - until we find a good online management tool that integrates document + version management, we store the Pitch idea at googledrive (check if it has versioning)
 - we might need different pitches for different parters (public, private) 

## Online management tools
 - we all agreed that trello lacks some important features, like good document and file management and a central calender
 - we are going to check out wiggio, yammer and other tools and try to agree on something today

## Website
