#Minutes hangouts meeting 25.03.2014

Attendees: Johanna, Marijn and Thomas (minutes)


##ERC grant
- create and get aligned 'visions' and construct a big erc proposal 
- ask experienced people (Robin Boost, NWO, the Italian public partner, people in the faculty) if it is wiser to have a 
big partner like BMC or a consortium of several smaller partners to match the money (Jan Hein, Marijn and Sabrina) 

##physical lab
Marijn talks to Rens about the rooms not used by the embedded researchers
- to have a place where the researchers can work and collaborate (even if it is one of our two rooms)
- thus to make coming to the office more attractive for the embedded researchers and trigger possible collaboration
- to ask if there is a replacement for Sanne coming
- to get him more involved in general terms

##Bauhaus
- Johanna sent her bio, referred to the coding the humanities peoples page
- tries to get us involved when they get back to her

##KIEM
- KIEM plans should be shaped within a week, to approach the italian public partner (template on github)

##to-do Thomas 
- send the guideline to Marijn and Jan Hein by tonight
- put a proposal of what he would like to do on github so Marijn and Sabrina (as potential main applicants) can have a 
look at it and give some advice about private partners
- after that I will write a profile of the private partner I am looking for and send it around, so e.g. Filip, Johanna can
scan their networks

##meetings
- try to agree on a longer meeting on Wednesdays and a brief meeting on Fridays
