# Minutes skype conference call 21.03.2014
Attendees: Filip, Johanna, Sabrina and Thomas (minutes)

## Github and gdrive
- it is difficult to get private partners and other externals to work on documents collaboratively if are not familiar with github
- we start with a folder in an private account until Jan Hein sets up a central gdrive for coding the humanities
- from that you can also link to a company and invite other people, which is however not for free
- everyone comes up with 'visions' on the the ideal way for the project to develop (imagine you had unlimited financial resources) which will automatically produce some nice and arguments paragraphs for pitches and proposals

##Private partners for KIEM

### Johanna / dark horse
- their focus is giving advice to companies about setting up co-operational spaces (virtual and physical)
- they are interested because, even though they teach at Universities, they do not have a project with a University in their portfolio yet and would like to start such a project from scratch
- want to get an more international profile, connect to companies in NL
- they want to give a datadrive presentation in Amsterdam and discuss the possibilities to proceed 
- their idea is to set up a 6-8 group cycle for a prototype space to develop a strategy
- they stressed the important to start out with physical space soon

### Sabrina / BMC
- BMC educational living laboratories, new kinds of collaborations in the field of education, quite well known in NL
- Sabrina is going to meet BMC Tuesday morning
- she is meeting another public partner from municipal of Amsterdam today, who is working on an open data project

- Sabrina meets Marijn this afternoon

## Upcoming events 
- Digital Bauhaus 2014 â€“ Design Creative Collaboration
- Weimar 29-30 June
- Johanna needs a bio and a short paragraph of research interests of everyone interested in joining or even giving a presentation
- Thomas is going to create cards on Trello of events like that

## Meetings 
- we agreed that it would be good to have regular meetings at a set time twice per week, e.g. one on Tuesday and one of Friday
- theses meeting do not have to be long but should allow everyone to report what they are working on and what is coming up / happened during the past week or days
- a fixed time makes the organization of meetings easier and it becomes less dramatic if someone cannot join one particular meeting
- Thomas will set up a doodle which should be filled out with regard to a regular meeting

## until next Tuesday
- we put relevant information together and start working on them 
- follow up with the private partners
- we should think about using conference calls instead of video calls
