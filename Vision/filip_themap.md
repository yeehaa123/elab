### summary

They key to successfully growing modern businesses is the efficient adaptation of technology and the structuring of communication processes within the company and with external parties. Traditionally this 'new' but essential form of communication is structured around translating the needs of the business to technical needs via prestructured schema's and methodologies. These methodologies are designed to keep the non-technical personel of the business protected from the ever changing details of the technical implementation while still giving them the capabilities to update the product through stories and evaluation of the prototypes.

Although these methodologies can lead to faster iterations in development, the control and knowledge of the non-techincal applicant stays well within bounds. This is a missed opportunity as the applicant has no particular idea as to why a certain expert or piece of technology is chosen. The only language the applicant has to communicate with is his own, a set of stories, product requirements and so on. The language of the tech department is unwieldly and constantly evolving with ever increasing rapid sprints. 

In that way the business will not progress beyon the strict and traditional social divisions created by the sudden penetration of companies by technical needs and teams. Almost every business has an IT department in some way or form. But as the need for technically educated personal grows and grows, that gap is not filled in in any way by the people that already populate the company. There is a huge group of people whose potential is hidden from the daily reality and who have no better means of communicating with tech teams unless through the methodologies invented by consultants and technical team leaders. From the perspective of the applicant the methodology just changes every so years but to them the language remains the same.

In order to unleash the potential of this group we need to redefine the tools and the language the applicant can use to communicate about the project, the needs or inventions. Just like a whole generation has learned to use and talk about the office software and tools they use, they should become more apt to define in some level of detail what elements of technical implementation is needed to fullfill the business needs. 

The key to changing the language is to evolve from the monolothic concepts of 'IT' or 'Tech' to a topology of elements that exist within the technical space and are just as easy to grasp as physical shapes in space. All of these elements or shapes are set on branches of a tree of functional, formal relationships and grammar. If the applicants learn to define their projects, of which they know best what the needs are in past and future, using such a topology and grammar they gain more control and the business gradually gains more technical expertise from within its own ranks. This will empower a new group of people to operate within an extending and growing technical business space. And it will also enable to more effectively communicate the importance to the next generation because as is well known, most offspring stay well within the career space of the parents. 

The concept of the tool is to create a self-learning and reflective environment that explores how a living topology can be created from the various expert sources that exist and the intersection of it with the needs and especially the language of non-technical applicants. Most learning starts with cloning and morphing clones, and so talking about technology and defining projects also starts with mimicking. The environment should be sensitive to levels of engagement and expertise, and each interaction with it should be weighed so its contribution to the topology remains well balanced. It is a social tool, a guide, a map. But is also about questions and answers, language, because each question creates a new answer. Structuring that play of language, and making it searchable is crucial to its success.
