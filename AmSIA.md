1. **Description of the idea**
*(Text: max 600 words)*

In the recent years we have witnessed an increasing demand in coding
experience in various working fields closely related to the humanities.
Knowledge institutions require programs to archive, search, digitize
and present their rich heritage. Media professionals, but also
archaeologists, musicians or historians more and more rely on digital
resources for their work and need basic coding skills to enhance their
workflow and research. But already at university level coding skills
become an important instrument to pursue ambitious research interests.

In order to face these challenges scientific foundations offer an
increasing number of grants that aim to accelerate innovative processes
in the creative industries and knowledge institutions, starting from
small national grants and to large internationally oriented funding
opportunities over extensive time spans. To boost collaborations between
private and public partners is one of the major goals of these programs.

THE CODING LAB is addressing these changing work and research
requirements by providing humanities students with an on- and offline
learning and research environment which allows them to develop and
apply coding skills, so that they are enabled to produce the customized
digital tools that fit their research and work. TCL is not only
increasing the employability of humanities students but also connects
external partners to students who understand to analyze and approach
humanities questions from the perspective of coding.

THE CODING LAB aims to be an incubator for collaborations between public
and private partners that are keen to explore new means of knowledge
production and productively challenge conventional forms of teaching and
scholarship by the creation of innovative information infrastructures
and research environments.

These ambitions are in line with research agenda promoted by
institutions like the European Research Council or the Dutch NWO.
