//maybe more as a general into in the proposal part/

The project seeks to explore the structures a platform/lab that works as a link between universities, cultural institutions and creative industries companies has to provide in order to trigger and foster long term collaborations between these parties. It considers platforms and methodologies used in software development, hacker, open data and open source culture.  

The creative industries, just as other industries, are facing far reaching changes of working processes. Work moves across borders, time zones and out of the office, becomes open, collaborative and flexible. In this development ICT play a crucial role. 

Governments and cultural institutions start to make their data accessible in order to allow third parties to develop tools which provide the basis to analyze, visualize and understand hidden structures. [(cf. opencultuurdata.nl)](http://www.opencultuurdata.nl/) 

At the same time universities widely rely on traditional structures of knowledge transfers and production. Moreover students in the humanities rely on prefabricated tools for research and collaboration. They do not yet apply the new methodologies developed by companies in the creative industries sector and they cannot utilize the open data available. 

Nevertheless, competitive funding calls now often encourage cooperation between universities and other institutions and companies in order to accelerate the knowledge transfer between academia and economy. Thus, in order to meet these challenges, the university as institution should explore and experiment with forms of gaining and sharing knowledge that ease the collaboration with other public and private partners.

As the underlying connection between the different partners is software, providing humanities students with coding skills and allow them to form and foster online peer learning structures bears a great potential for cooperation with creative industries SMEs and the open data policies of humanities related institutions.

#Project proposal 

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
>**"Any tool should be useful in the expected way, but a truly great tool lends itself to uses you never expected."** (Eric Steven Raymond *The Cathedral and the Bazaar*, p.18)


**objectives**

The intention of the proposed project is to, together with a private partner, research and conceptualize the parameters for an online learning environment for humanities students that want to learn coding. The design of the platform has to concider the integration of the learning environment into a physical lab. In its very structure it also has to integrate instruments that ease collaboration and engagenent of external parties. 

The project will proceed in three stages. Stage one is research phase in which the pitfalls and potentials of MOOCS, blended learning, open source collaborations are scrutinized. The second stages focuses on the conceptual design of an online platform that can be linked to a physical lab (cf. KIEM proposal XXX) and due to its open character encourages collaboration with public and private parties. In this phasis also a prototype is created. In the last phases the prototype is made accessible to coding the humanities students and cooperations with other public and private partners are initiated. 

These differt stages serve to prepare for a joint application to the HORIZON 2020 grant *New Froms of Innovation - Platform for ICT for Learning and Inclusion*. 


**general introduction**

The creative industries, just as other industries, are facing far reaching changes of working processes. Work moves across borders, time zones and out of the office, becomes open, collaborative and flexible. In this development ICT play a crucial role. 

Governments and cultural institutions start to make their data accessible in order to allow third parties to develop tools which provide the basis to analyze, visualize and understand hidden structures. [(cf. opencultuurdata.nl)](http://www.opencultuurdata.nl/) 

At the same time universities widely rely on traditional structures of knowledge transfers and production. Moreover students in the humanities rely on prefabricated tools for research and collaboration. They do not yet apply the new methodologies developed by companies in the creative industries sector and they cannot utilize the open data available. 

Communal organized activist networks take munipilalitys open data and work with it in order to strenghten civic society and to improve local political stuctures and processes. 

Todays digital devices provide great tools in terms of communication, connecting, collaborating, searching, visualizing. Yet, in humanities departments these tools are hardly used. Even digital humanities mainly focus on the development of ITC *for* humanities students not on educating these students in developing those tools themselves.
Thus our appoach is user centred and focuses on agency. The students learn to alter the digital instruments in their function. The application of open source strategies, like openess, thourough documentation and group learning encourages social integration and aim to provide a better understanding of the degital tools we hold in our hands - not only for humanities students.

At the same time the university has the chance to reconsider its classical form of top down education and open up to new forms of knowledge creating and transfer that is in line with workprocesses in creative industries companies, open data movements.

**underlying concepts**

software linux 
- collaboration
- early releases
- many users
- open to use free licenses 
- good documentation
- people work with most motivation if they find their own problems to work on

communal informatics
- an online community should be supplemented by a geographycal / physical community
- people are motivated as citizens / doing something for society
- self-learning, no mere use of ITC but understanding
- countermovement to the commercialized internet

open data movements

github
- not the person, the problem is of relevance


This approach holds several advantages compared to current hierarchical university teaching: 
It encourages collaboration between stundents and allows them to develop peer learning strategies, discover and fix mistakes or wrong assumtions early on in the process. It allows them to form interest groups that come up with different projects which could be directed pon specific needs, e.g. in relation to humanities research and open data from cultural institutions or in form of community informatics.


>**"...while coding remains an essentially solitary activity, the really great hacks come from harnessing the attention and brainpower of entire communities."**
(Eric Steven Raymond The Cathedral and the Bazaar, p.22)

The open, accessible form in which the projects are created and shared allows third parties, from community grassroots movements, to other students, SMEs or knowledge institutions to approach a particular project group in order to participate, provide open data to work with or offer consultancy. At the same time the projects resist closure. Even if a course work based group project comes to halt after the seminar is over, other keen programmers can still adopt the code, alter and apply it for their purpose, develop it further and foster new collaborations. Due to creative common licence / open source licenses and good documentation that allows successors to understand what has been done.  

Companies that work with new licensens Treehouse, Linux

hich refers to the use of legal tools (open licenses) that give everyone permission to reuse and modify educational resources 

you are not aware of the better models developed outside of your organisation

This experimental learning environments that seeks to combine online learing and livng lab challenges the structuresare still dominant in academic exchange of knowledge, however, do not take into account the successful new ways
to share knowledge and are increasingly adopted by public and private institutions. These ways of working and learning have their origin in
hacker culture, software development, and the open source movement.

The university has to take into consideration these structures and means of collaboration.
In order to allow for SMEs that already apply these forms to create concepts and knowledge.
In order to make the humanities students more employable 

##approach

**Research phase**
- research on MOOCs and elearning, open source and hacker culture, community informatics
	- what are useful components for coding the humanities?
	- which components that are useful for coding the humanities do other platforms lack?

**conceptual phase**
- from results form phasis one, develop a concept of the coding the humanities learning platform 
- develop a concept of the integration in a physical lab 
	- with focus on community building strategies
	- focus on self-learning peer-group learning (difference to blended learning: students are not passive receivers but can quite early on engage in own projects and collaborate, the problem solving oriented approach motivates group dynamics)
- develop a concept for the kick-off and fostering of projects
- develop a concept of potential cooperations (open data projects, SMEs, other universities), e.g. through a forum in which civics 

**roll out**
- open pilot to coding the humanities students
- initiate collaborations with other public and private partners
-  
- develop communicative strategies to involve laymen, in form of events in the lab

##7. Fit within Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda
*State within which of the seven CLICKNL networks your project proposal fits (see Chapter 2). Give reasons why your KIEM
application fits in this part of the Creative Industry's Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda. You may use a maximum
of 400 words in this part. Please state the number of words used.*


<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
The project proposal fits the CLICKNL network Media & ICT as it seeks to enable community processes based on ICT and explores how these
technologies can be made accessible and integrative.

On the basis of the online environment developed together with the private partners students become educated in the crossover of humanities and ICT and therefore meet the growing market demand for humanities students with insights in programming. These students will have a good understanding for technical and media developments and their possible translation into humanities research and their integration as according tools in that field.

The same platform will, due to its open peer-to-peer learning approach, produce knowledge on innovative and effective online learning and collaboration through the use and development of smart and social media. This allows to handle larger research projects as these projects no longer need to be divided into several topics or objects, but people can divide labor through different tasks and skill sets, using tools developed by humanities scholars for humanities scholarship. Hence, this approach encourages the formation international partnerships with public institutions and private partners and thus contributes to the internationalization processes aspired by the CLICKNL agenda.

At the same time the platform encourages the formation of research based groups and communities that can develop sustainable, open
access projects which can be applied, adapopted and developed further, e.g. working with open data sets. The use of open colaborative 
platforms such as github will allow to extend these groups beyond the circle of UvA humanities students, to engaged citizens, to other Universities, knowledge institutes and SMEs.

##9. Reasons for public-private partnership
*Explain here which question or need from the private partners and/or the knowledge institution makes the formation of a
PPP worthwhile in light of the main objective of KIEM (see Chapter 2 of the call for proposals). You may use a maximum of
700 words in this part. Please state the number of words used.*

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
The private partner has an expertise in modes of learning, knowledge tranfers and supporting and fostering resulting project groups.
The company can probe their expertise in an open environment that challenges the divide between academic, laymen and economic practice.
It gains insight into the character of digital tools that humanities students in prarticular and knowledge instutions in general need. 

Universities, on the other hand, increasingly have to rely on competetive funding calls that intent to foster the cooperation between
public and private players. In order to encourage these cooperations, they have to consider and experient with modes of knowledge production that are already put in practice in SMEs. This focus on an open learning environment allows the coming into being of long term, sustainable projects which also can be adopted by and altered by other developers - private or public. 

In the long run the pool of humanities students could be approach by museums and other cultural institutions in order to allow them to work with their data. Moreover students become more employable already get in touch with companies in form of private partners.

The seminar *Coding the Humanities* already provides humanities students with basic coding skills, teaches them how to use collaborative platforms like github, peer review their work and pursue little coding projects on their own. A pilot of the online learning environment is going to be tested in the summer semester 2014. Apart from that the project *Augmented Masterpieces* explores new forms of interaction with artworks in the museum context in collaboration with the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam. **Center For Creative Industries**  **Center for Digital Humanities** 

These different projects are meant to inform the large scale ambition to create the digital learning environment which will be accompanied by a physical lab. 

This learning environment will produce students with the unique but increasingly necessary skill combination of humanties and coding background. These students therefore are well prepared, e.g. for open data projects in which cultural institutions make their data accessible and benefit from diverse approaches of how to work with this data.
