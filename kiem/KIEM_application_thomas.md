application in the framework of one of the larger NWO/TNO/CLICKNL funding rounds, joint project proposals, series of 
meetings, etc. Please also state when you expect these results to be realised and who will realise the results concerned.*

||||
|                  |              |                         |


###b) Action plan
*Describe how the results will be realised. You should also explain specifically how the results will lead to the setting
up, consolidating or strengthening of a PPP collaboration within the Creative Industry. You may use a maximum of 700 
words in this part. Please state the number of words used.*


##11. Project budget
*Use the table on the grant page to draw up the project budget. Save the table as a PDF file and upload this as a 
separate attachment with your application.* 

*In the budget you should state:
- the human resources requested from NWO for the entire duration of the grant (at least one replacement grant of at least
6 months and at least 0.1 fte (standard payment: â‚¬ 2500))
- the material resources requested from NWO for the entire duration of the grant;
- the size of the contributions from the private partners.*

*Further you are requested to:
a) to justify all of the resources requested.
b) to describe what the contributions from the partners consist of.*

*N.B. Only costs that are solely and directly related to the research proposal may be requested from NWO. NWO always 
remunerates â‚¬ 15,000 of the total budget per project proposal. The compulsory matching contribution from the private 
partner(s) is at least â‚¬ 3000 and at least â‚¬ 1500 of this must be in cash. The total project budget is therefore at 
least â‚¬ 18,000.*

##12. Public summary
*Write a public summary of your project in Dutch using no more than 50 words. This should be aimed at a wide public. 
Give this summary a catching title in Dutch. This public summary can be used by NWO for publicity purposes. Instructions
and examples can be found at [www.nwo.nl/publiekssamenvatting](www.nwo.nl/publiekssamenvatting).*
