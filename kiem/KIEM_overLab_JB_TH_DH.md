#Project proposal 

<<<<<<< HEAD
>Wir haben daher bei der Fabrik der Zukunft eher an wissenschaftliche Laboratorien, 
>Kunstakademien und an Bibliotheken und Diskotheken zu denken als an die gegenwärtigen
>Fabriken. Und den Apparatmenschen der Zukunft haben wir uns eher als einen Akademiker
>denn als einen Handwerker, Arbeiter oder Ingenieur vorzustellen. 83 (Flusser 2002b: 170)

The recent development towards more interdisciplinary research settings in the humanities, 
which span not only from one faculty research group to another or between universities but 
more and more towards involving private partners from the creative industries, changes the 
requirements of how researchers operate.

The embedded researcher's profile is a short-term research project which seeks to establish 
sustainable collaborations between the creative industries and universities. 

The work space of the embedded researchers are regular office spaces at the university, 
supplied with a desk and a computer. The scope of most projects however require a variety 
of work settings.

When working from a human-centered approach it is crucial to not think of the form of the 
outcome right away or to be limited to just one medium or technology. But in order to 
experiment and innovate, a flexible workspace is needed. Artistic expression and creativity 
do not obey closing hours and bureaucratic sterility of university buildings. 	

Need
- increasing need of knowledge workers to combine theoretical as well as hands-on approaches 
in their research
- current workspaces do not provide enough space and the right material to experiment

Challenge
How could the ideal workspace for knowledge workers within the faculty of the humanities at 
the UvA look like?
How could the working environment be adapted to meet the changed research requirements of 
knowledge workers at the Departments for Digital Humanities, Media Studies, Cultural Analysis 
and Artistic Research?

How to
user-centered approach Design Thinking
- aims at ﬁnding out about users’s needs via an ethnographic research tools
- synthesizes, narrows insights down to hit the core of a problem
- condensed synthesis enables to start into an ideation part
- generates a broad variety of ideas
- makes ideas tangible in rapid and rough prototypes, cost-efﬁcient development

*State the total duration of the project and the intended starting date here. 
N.B. The project has a minimum duration of 6 months and a maximum duration of 1 year. As stated in the call, the project
must start within 6 weeks of the grant being awarded.*

// Yeehaa: Translate to English Don't start things with generic
historical observations! Get to the problem quicker. For instance
like this://

Embedded researcher is a new and exiting role within the university.
Its goal is to establish sustainable partnerships between private
partners and universities. In practice, however, this turns out to be
problematic, since the role and position of this kind of researcher is
peripheral by definition. The embedded research usual works on short
term projects and inbetween the academy and a company.

We believe that a virtual and physical lab is essential to compensate
for the abovementioned problems. An online and offline platform - that
already exists before they start, and will start after their contracts
end - a is a necessary precondition for ER project that are actually
sustainable. In this project we want to explore how such a lab should
look like. 

The work space of the embedded researchers are regular office
spaces at the university, supplied with a desk and a computer. The scope
of most projects however require a variety of work settings.

When working from a human-centered approach it is crucial to not        
think of the form of the outcome right away or to be limited to just    
one medium or technology. But in order to experiment and innovate, a    
flexible workspace is needed. Artistic expression and creativity do not 
obey closing hours and bureaucratic sterility of university buildings.

Intended Starting date: May 1st, 2014.

The project will take place during 10 months and is divided in three 	phases. 
The first phase consists of finding needs and shaping the concrete requirements 
of the lab. During the second phase the prototype lab is being set up and tested by the 
embedded researchers throughout their concrete projects. 
The third phase is dedicated to adjust the lab with the feedback from the second 
phase and to ...

##7. Fit within Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda
<<<<<<< HEAD
*State within which of the seven CLICKNL networks your project proposal fits (see Chapter 2). Give reasons why your KIEM
application fits in this part of the Creative Industry's Strategic Research and Innovation Agenda. You may use a maximum
of 400 words in this part. Please state the number of words used.*

Future University related research has to be informed by open methodologies. Increasingly funding is spread competitively 
for small research periods, also in order to foster the collaboration between the public and the private sector, 
for example in the form of embedded researchers.
Even though the emphasis here is on sustainable research, the projects are often closed and presented and not open for 
further development (unless some additional funding allows to proceed)
Truely sustainable research is OPEN and would mean that a project has releases - at some point (after the official end 
of the research period) other students, embedded researchers are allowed and encouraged to take the outcome of the 
research, alter and develop it further. 

"However, because these entities represent exceptions to the principle of organizing our research programs within 
regular academic channels, they may create unique challenges that must be addressed in order for them to succeed."

The Dark Horse 		
Dark Horse is an innovation agency based in Berlin. We create user-centered products and services and help clients 
to change their structures, processes and minds. Our work is based on Design Thinking principles and our own unusual 
working culture that simultaneously stresses ﬂexibility and connections. We design spatial, procedural and social 
conditions of collaboration. 		

Expertise
Dark Horse is multidisciplinary and highly collaborative in it’s working culture. We designed and installed our ofﬁce 
according to our needs. Through different projects with big corporates such as Deutsche Bahn, Lufthansa, Telekom and 
Volkswagen we gained experiences and learned about challenges as well as opportunities in other companies and know about 
how the right working environment can foster successful collaboration. Via our participative design approach, we created 
spaces and working culture for collaboration in science and creative industry. 		
Our team for „Pototyping the e-Lab“ consists of an interior designer and an anthropologist. These two expertises combine 
the ethnographic 	tools to ﬁnd out about users’ needs as well as the implementation expertise.


##9. Reasons for public-private partnership
*Explain here which question or need from the private partners and/or the knowledge institution makes the formation of a
PPP worthwhile in light of the main objective of KIEM (see Chapter 2 of the call for proposals). You may use a maximum of

Intended results: The outcome of this project will consist of a written concept that describes the spatial requirements 
as well as a 3D-model of the future space. For the realization of this concept another funding will be needed.

Research questions that are being adressed [Questions adjusted from “Rationale and Impact” for Establishing and Managing 
Independent Laboratories, Institutes and Centers at the Stanford University.]
How can embedded research projects most effectively be realized when conducted and managed outside of existing 
organizational units?
What is the likelihood of long-term and active participation in the OverLab structure by faculty and (graduate) students?
What impact (positive or negative) will the OverLab have on the participating faculties' home academic department?
What resources will be required to support the unit, and how will those resources be obtained and managed?
To what extent will establishment of the new entity help to attract external support?
Does the UvA have the expertise and resources for the new program to become one of the top centers in the country in its field?

- the human resources requested from NWO for the entire duration of the grant (at least one replacement grant of at least
6 months and at least 0.1 fte (standard payment: € 2500))
- the material resources requested from NWO for the entire duration of the grant;
- the size of the contributions from the private partners.*

*Further you are requested to:
a) to justify all of the resources requested.
b) to describe what the contributions from the partners consist of.*

*N.B. Only costs that are solely and directly related to the research proposal may be requested from NWO. NWO always 
remunerates € 15,000 of the total budget per project proposal. The compulsory matching contribution from the private 
partner(s) is at least € 3000 and at least € 1500 of this must be in cash. The total project budget is therefore at 
least € 18,000.*
