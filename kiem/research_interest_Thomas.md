## Why digital humanities is not enough

The so called digital humanities often focus on automated data
acquisition and processing, visualizations and analysis of such data.
//Yeehaa: clumsy sentence rewrite /Students of the various humanities
fields get acquainted with special software /Yeehaa: Such as? /
written and designed in order to enhance their research. In this
approach IT experts, mostly situated in classical computer science
departments, create specialized (goal oriented) tools that meet the
needs of disciplinary research. The students are then trained to use
the software. This methodology confirms traditional teacher-student,
laymen-expert relations, in which the students do not necessarily gain
insights into the complex programs they apply.

The structures that are still dominant in academic exchange of
knowledge, however, do not take into account the successful new ways
to share knowledge and are increasingly adopted by public and private
institutions. These ways of working and learning have their origin in
hacker culture, software development, and the open source movement.

At the same time / Yeehaa: why at the same time. try specifying the     
exact nature of this relation / jhacking" is driven by a curiosity      
towards tools. It is motivated by the urge to understand, improve or    
simply functionally change a tool at hand. Here techne and episteme     
/ Yeehaa: avoind academic jargon here. it is not necesary. Introduce    
later / are meant to reconnect by a instance in which the unconscious   
/ Yeehaa: Why unconscious / act of using a tool (of application         
knowledge) is disrupted on account of a distant and closer look at the  
tool. /Yeehaa: Too fast, explain this more in detail. /

## The Black Box 

Never before have the technological devices we hold in our hands been
so powerful on a functional level. / Yeehaa: never use unfounded
historical claims! /Likewise, never before have the same tools been
so opaque. / Yeehaa: ditto! / While scrutinizing the inside of a
mechanical machine might have allowed the user to understand the
mechanisms at hand and thus to manipulate or repair it, this approach
- to understand the functionality of a tool by investigating its
structural architecture - is not very applicable to circuit boards
and cpu's. / Yeehaa: Why? / So how can a layman, that is: no engineer
or computer scientist, acquire knowledge about the contemporary black
boxes, the technological gadgets predominating her/ his objective world.
Due to their functional openness, in order to repair or manipulate these
electronic devices, it has become crucial to understand the rules by
which these gadgets operate. Technical agency does not depend so much
on the level of understanding of the hardware but of the software or
the code of a device. / Yeehaa: why, are not both equally important?
/ However, smoothly operating, graphically stylized interfaces hide
the rules according to which the devices are functioning. The surface
is meant to work intuitively - it is the executioner of the operating
manual. /Yeehaa: is a game only the executioner of its rules too? / The
user engages with these tools as *user* merely. /Yeehaa: What does
merely mean here? / She/he cannot grasp the *zeug* that is *zuhanden*
- she cannot step back and transform the object in her hand into a
*thing* that is *vorhanden* [Still have to check out "Das Ding namens
Computer"](http://www.transcript-verlag.de/978-3-8376-1951-5/das-ding-na
mens-computer#). *Techné* and superficial application knowledge prevent
a distant scrutinizing which would disclose the vulnerability such a
knowledge and motivate a deeper functional and structural understanding
of the device.

The only instant to become aware of a tool is when it is missing,
broken, malfunctioning or lacking a function, e.g. not letting the user
do what she needs to do. / Yeehaa: do you *only* know that you have legs
when they get amputated? / Thus the user needs to create a sensibility
for what a device or program is lacking and cannot do (yet).

/ Yeehaa: Try to make this analysis a lot more subtle. /


##Why focus on collaborative code?

As explained in the previous paragraph, the focus on code is the
easiest /Yeehaa: Really? / and most flexible to manipulate the gadgets
surrounding us. More than ever before do technological gadgets encourage
us to shape them. Since the emphasis shifted from material to symbolic
in-formation / Yeehaa: lingo and historical generalization == 2 x bad!
/ the new gadgets can be changed in function by programming without
having to touch upon their structure. Due to the fast development of
the internet of things and smart objects, not only the function of
computers, tablets, phones can be altered but also the function of more
and more tools and objects in our everyday life can be manipulated
through code. Thus technical knowledge and agency in more general terms
will increasingly depend on coding skills.

- the more people tinker with code and technological devices the better the devices 
- education through technology and technology through education (and hopefully less through DARPA & CO)!
- knowledge can change the development, production and application process of technology
- collaborative platforms like github show the potential for early cooperation and releases in order to improve the development process
- whereas engineering asks for a diverse set of skills, coding allows an easy way to alter the function of a device 
- very early on in the learning process languages like html or JavaScript allow to tinker

##Research interests 

- understand how technical / technological knowledge has been and is formally and informally acquired (e.g. user manuals)
- thus what is the difference between lab, workshop, classroom? 
- the tension between online and offline learning and what is a lab? 
- which kind of virtual and physical environments encourage the process of gaining technical / technological knowledge?
- how can we combine techne and episteme in a productive, recursive circle? 


##Approach
 
Define different levels of technical and technological knowledge (still have to dive into Günter Ropohl's terminology), 
e.g.
- technical understanding in the sense of physical labor, processes, embodiment
- handling understanding / application knowledge (people know which buttons on the outside to push to make a gadget work)
- extended understanding of apparatuses (functionally and structurally, able to repair)
- designing and constructing apparatuses (engineer mode)

(As a first step one could develop an online questionaire to find out
which technical devices humanities students possess, which kind of
programs they use in general, which kind of programs for their research
and which programming languages the use)

If we look for inspiration, we come across the hacker subculture that
strives to not to take the objects in their hands for granted but
instead tinker with it and find a new function for it. Often hackers
are autodidacts. Maybe this circumstance lead to a particular ethos
of sharing knowledge, writing manuals and develop a particular mode
of cooperation. How is technical knowledge acquired and organized by
hackers?

- think of what an object should be able to do instead of following a users guide
- if resistance is encountered, think of ways to overcome it, on an individually and a collaborative level
- think of what a device should and could be good for instead of simply applying determined functions
- abuse and alter given functions (digital situanism - well, only touching the application knowledge) 
- tinker and play in order to generate knowledge
- tinker, play, don't be goal oriented 
- do not forget about the "why?" while you are dealing with the "how?"
- cooperate and share, describe and structure what you found
- create rupture in the smooth application procedures (UX) 
- Enforce an oscillation between techne and episteme.  

(**Integrate Lessons from** [The Cathedral and the Bazaar](http://www.unterstein.net/su/docs/CathBaz.pdf)

1. Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's personal itch.
2. Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse).
3. Plan to throw one version away; you will, anyhow. (Copied from Frederick Brooks' The Mythical Man Month)
4. If you have the right attitude, interesting problems will find you.
5. When you lose interest in a program, your last duty to it is to hand it off to a competent successor.
6. Treating your users as co-developers is your least-hassle route to rapid code improvement and effective debugging.
7. Release early. Release often. And listen to your customers.
8. Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the 
fix obvious to someone.
9. Smart data structures and dumb code works a lot better than the other way around.
10. If you treat your beta-testers as if they're your most valuable resource, they will respond by becoming your most 
valuable resource.
11. The next best thing to having good ideas is recognizing good ideas from your users. Sometimes the latter is better.
12. Often, the most striking and innovative solutions come from realizing that your concept of the problem was wrong.
13. Perfection (in design) is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing more to 
take away. (Attributed to Antoine de Saint-Exupéry)
14. Any tool should be useful in the expected way, but a truly great tool lends itself to uses you never expected.
15. When writing gateway software of any kind, take pains to disturb the data stream as little as possible—and never 
throw away information unless the recipient forces you to!
16. When your language is nowhere near Turing-complete, syntactic sugar can be your friend.
17. A security system is only as secure as its secret. Beware of pseudo-secrets.
18. To solve an interesting problem, start by finding a problem that is interesting to you. 
19. Provided the development coordinator has a communications medium at least as good as the Internet, and knows how to 
lead without coercion, many heads are inevitably better than one.)


## Why humanities

Pure IT-experts often only ask “How?” to solve a particular problem
but do not consider the “Why?” of the bigger picture. We have to
stop celebrating every new startup that is just providing one more
e-commerce platform. As technical gadgets become more intuitive to use
and visual based, the underlying rules are covered up. The discrepancy
between superficial understanding and the functional and structural
complexity of the devices increases. How fragile this superficial
application understanding is, becomes clear the moment a program breaks
down or the stylized graphical surface does not allow user to perform a
particular task.


##The Challenge

To increase the level of technical / techological knowledge of students 
and layman. Allow them to wonder about (phenomenology of technics)      
the black boxes they hold in their hands. Make them aware of the fact   
that they can peek inside those boxes, understand and manipulate their  
function by mastering the rules the black boxes rely on. By mastering   
their code.                                                             

Allow them to mutually develop and foster their curiosity by sharing and
collaboration. Allow them to learn and invent. Motivate them to document
their finding and allow others to play with these findings.


##Potential Private Partners
- a company that is specialized in making knowledge accessible 
- a company that operates between webprogramming and art
- a company that is interested in UX as interference
