Coding the Humanities

Coding the Humanities provides an online learning platform that allows humanities students to develop coding skills collaboratively with online exercises, modules, discussion boards and a distributed repository that enables them to share, reuse and extend their coding projects. An  on- and offline course compliments the online platform with practical assignments, theoretical discussions and critical reflection.

The students develop a unique skillset that allows them to understand the various technologically mediated objects that they are studying. Moreover it prepares them to handle and customize digital tools that are increasingly needed by museums, archives, libraries and other knowledge institutions: for the archiving, semantic search, data analysis, visualization and presentation of their collections.

The combination of programming skills and a humanities education empowers the students to exceed the perspective of IT experts and to develop a set of customized tools that can improve the actual practice of humanities research as well as (the quantity and quality of) its output.
